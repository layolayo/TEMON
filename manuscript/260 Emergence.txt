# Emergence {#emergence}

{style=poem}
~~~~~~
Back when I was young
Parts of me still hang
A future path, undefined
Those parts still
	frozen in time

Then brought to the fore
To the here and now
Experienced again
Re-wound

Now shaken & stirred
   upset & confused
The growing up again has just begun
Old feelings, words and states of mind
Are felt
   then blow away

Did we hold on to remember?
To relinquish control?
To be safe and secure in a cruel world?

Now

Stepping out into sunshine
Blue skies and change
These old baby eyes are renewed
To see a new world
Experienced again
   "Don't take it away!"

... and release ...

It's only a passing phase
As the young fills its space
   on the inside

To grow and be whole
To be in the world
And the fear is not here at all
