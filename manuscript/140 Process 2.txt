# Process #2 - The Six Steps

Here follows one of the basic Emergent Knowledge processes David created. It clearly presents four of the core functions of EK:

* Download
* Upload
* Over-Drive
* Meta-Drive

## Introduction

The process is written as though being delivered by a facilitator, though it is entirely possible to adapt it and use this process for self-facilitation.

Through the process the client moves through six separate spaces and in each one of these spaces a series of iterative questions are asked of them about what they know about their 'issue'.

Each space they occupy is appropriately named and labelled thus providing a visual and spatial marker to represent the evolving knowledge and the system in which it belongs.

## The Six Steps Process

1. Download and Upload from A
	a. "What would you like to work on / attend to this session?"
	b. "Put all that on there" - client writes down their answer
2. Locate B
	a. "Place that where it belongs" - client places paper
3. Meta-Drive A
	a. "Position yourself where are you now in relation to that." - client moves to a space
4. Over-Drive A
	a. "And what (else) do you know about that from here?" ask this six times
	    i. Note that clients often write down these answers, this information could be placed at A, B or even somewhere new.
5. Reference Viewpoint of A
	a. "And what could this space be called?" - client writes name of space
	b. "Place that where it belongs"
6. Download and Upload from A
	a. "And what do you know now about all of this?"
	b. "Represent that" or "Write that down"
	c. "Place that where it belongs"
7. Meta-Drive A
	a. "Move to a new space"
8. Repeat Steps 4. to 7. five more times
9. Meta-Drive A
	a. "Return to your original space"
10. Download from A
	a. "And what do you know now from here?"
11. Recognise Difference
	a. "And what is the difference between what you know now and when you started?"
