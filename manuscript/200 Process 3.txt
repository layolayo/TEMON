# Process #3 - The Basic Four Flows

Here follows an introductory process designed to open up and begin an exploration of the Four Fundamental Flows with respect to an existing condition.

This process provides the base structure to deeper and more involved processes in this category. 

## Introduction

This is a simple process to run for the beginning facilitator. Once the client has detailed what it is they would like to work on, the iterative question sets look to explore what is happening in each of the four flows, from the client's (A) perspective.

Clean Space methodology is utilised throughout, thus all answers are generally spoken first then represented on paper and placed in space.

After each iterative question set, a new Recognition Stage is initiated to keep the client in the present moment. Each time the new statement is given a location and the client moves to where they are in relationship to it.

Allow the client to freely move around the space as they feel necessary.

## The Basic Four Flows Process

* *"Represent what you'd like to work on, place this where it belongs"*
* *"And where are you now in relationship to that?"*
* *"And what could this space be called?"*

### Four Flows from A's Viewpoint

Standing in your space run through the following question sets. Answering, writing down and placing this answer for each question:
 
#### Check the Four Flows

1. *"And what must you not get from that?"*
  * "Place that where it belongs"*
2. *"And what must you get from that?"*
  * "Place that where it belongs"*
3. *"And what must you make sure that doesn't get from you?"*
  * "Place that where it belongs"*
4. *"And what must you make sure that does get from you?"*
  * "Place that where it belongs"*

#### New Recognition Stage

Download, Upload and create a new Viewpoint

a. *"And what do you know now about all of this?"*
b. *"Place that where it belongs"*
c. *"And place yourself where you are now in relationship to that?"*
d. *"And what could this space be called?"*

#### Iterate

Repeat the Four Flows and Recognition stages five more times

### Finishing Off

1. *"Choose a new space outside of all of this"*
2. *"And what do you know from here?"*
3. *"And what else do you know from here?"* x 5
4. *"And what do you know now?"*  
5. *"Go back to your original space."*
6. *"And what do you know from here now?"*

### An Unravelling

Throughout our lives we make so many choices, have so many choices made for us, have so many defining moments occur, etc. and after all of these and every other twist and turn that a life may take, this all ties up our thinking and understanding about ourselves or a situation into condensed and tangled knots.

This process is designed to unravel these knots, because of this there may be moments during a session where one comes across an old problem or an old structure that had been forgotten all about, this is part of the unravelling and this problem will now in its own way unravel to bring a deep clarity and balance to the person.

### Clarity and Balance

These terms 'clarity' and 'balance' are excellent references to describe where this process may lead us to. For each intention, each movement and each flow we consider and recognise is a thread in these knots and as we unpick and gently release each one. And through further iterations the revealing and releasing of those underlying threads previously hidden and tightly bound, everything begins to coalesce and take on a new form.

This new form brings a sense of relief and a dissolution of the original problem for the client, allowing them to act and respond in a new and more positive way moving forward.
