# Appendix 4 - Origins of Process #4

## Source and History of Process #4

### Self-Alignment

I began working with an early form of this process in 2008, where in my sessions the client was guided to locate aspects of the self that existed prior to who they were in the here and now. Several of these aspects would be mapped out in space in relation to the client. Future aspects of self and intention were looked at by asking *"And, what would you like to have happen?"* and *"And, what kind of you is that you?"* these were also mapped out in space (aspects of this process can be seen in the 2008 Self-Alignment 7-day Journey).

Moving on from this initial form, I was investigating relationships between exposed aspects with the standard Clean Space procedures of asking what was in-between these aspects, this was performed to elicit and explore the client's barriers, boundaries and unconscious structures.

### A New Clean Start

At this time I was also looking at cleaning up the starting conditions of the process, from asking *"And, what would you like to have happen?"* or *"And, what would you like to work on?"* or *"And, what have you come here to address?"* to something even less presumptive.

This developing idea came at the same time I was working on the Clean based game 'And â€¦', I had noticed that during that game several interesting questions were presented, two of these were:

* *"And, where might you come from?"*
* *"And, where might you be?"*

### UCP

Up to this point I had not made the leap to adapt and bring those two questions in to the present moment with *"And, where are you now?"* It was here during my research that I became aware of Penday's Universal Conscious Practice and suddenly recognised that the Emergent process I was working with at that time was a very close cousin to the process presented by him in 2002.

After discovering this relationship between the processes, I was intrigued but also reserved in translating the style of what I was doing across to that used in UCP. I decided at that time to retain the Clean and more facilitator intensive style I was working with.

However, in 2017 I dropped the reservation and my own methodology and simply recognised that the structure of Penday's method constituted a Clean approach and is probably as streamlined as the process could be, especially for training purposes.

### Emergent Implementation

I maintain that the actual implementation of this process does require the Grovian touch and methodology, hence the use of Clean Space, Iteration and Clean facilitation. None of which are mentioned in Penday's original work, although he did have his own interpretation of what we now call Clean.

I've reinterpreted the UCP process from an Emergent perspective, which is a very different approach from which Penday's process was conceived. I make this statement to make clear that the two approaches are not linked in any way and the usage of the UCP question structure does not qualify this.
