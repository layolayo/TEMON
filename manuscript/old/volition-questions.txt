MODAL LANGUAGE - Is this actually required here?

Understanding this relationship allows us to make use of modal language in our questions to stimulate and access the awareness at varying levels on the spectrums.

For instance, if we ask *"And what are you able to receive from B?"* we are operating at the lower end of the Expose spectrum and, as we get towards the extremity of the Expose spectrum, we get questions more like *"And what must you get from (or even 'out of') B?"*

Each of the four zones of volition utilise the grammatical modal operators of that area. In this section, we will take a brief look at these in further detail. 

The following sections apply the Volition Model to each of the four flows to produce a definite set of questions within each set.

Realised through determination

Realised through exposing and revelation with pressure or force

* *What are you supposed to get from that?*

Realised through disinclination or objection

* *What wouldn't you like to get from that?*
* *What don't you wish to get from that?*
* *What do you not want to get from that?*
* *What won't you get from that?*

##### Modal Operators of the Necessary (negative)

Realised through rejection with pressure or force

* *What shouldn't you get from that?*
* *What do you have to not get from that?*
* *What must you not get from that?*

##### Modal Operators of the Probable

Realised by request and influence

* *What might you make sure that does get from you?*
* *What could you make sure that does get from you?*

Realised by inspiration and encouragement

* *What would you like to make sure that does get from you?*
* *What do you wish to make sure that does get from you?*
* *What do you want to make sure that does get from you?*
* *What will you make sure that does get from you?*

##### Modal Operators of the Necessary

Realised through projection, insistence and demands with pressure or force

* *What are you supposed to make sure that does get from you?*
* *What should you make sure that does get from you?*
* *What do you have to make sure that does get from you?*
* *What must you make sure that does get from you?*

#### Conceal (In-Flowing - Source Set)

##### Modal Operators of the Impossible

Realised through distraction or diversion

* *What are you able to make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What can you make sure that doesn't get from you?*

##### Modal Operators of the Improbable

Realised through disguise or deception

* *What might you make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What could you make sure that doesn't get from you?*

##### Modal Operators of the Averse

Realised through withholding and retaining

* *What would you like to make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What do you wish to make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What do you want to make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What will you make sure that doesn't get from you?*

##### Modal Operators of the Necessary (negative)

Realised through restriction and secreting with pressure or force

* *What are you supposed to make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What should you make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What do you have to make sure that doesn't get from you?*
* *What must you make sure that doesnâ€™t get from you?*

These models are still being worked on, and the discovery of what is located, and of value through these language patterns and processes, is still in progress. Current indications, along with the supporting EK theoretical model, show that the most pronounced and significant changes are made when accessing the upper necessity zone of the spectrums. This is considered to be the area of therapeutic intervention work.

We may also utilise this model to recognise where someone currently resides by carefully listening to the language they are using.  
  
  Once this area has been resolved, clients are then fully able to accurately access information within the second and third zones, where sessions are more aligned with a coaching style of intervention.
