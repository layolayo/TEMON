# Notes for the Advancing Facilitator

Here are some short essays on various aspects of Emergence and related items. Each of these has the potential to open up into a tome of knowledge in themselves. Watch this space!

## A Fractal Solution

It is around now that you may notice, as Pam proposed, that the emergent pattern is fractal in nature. The seven [1+six] question pattern works at the lowest level and each successive round of questions brings with it another larger scaled iteration of the client's issue and their understanding of it.

This is why we look at running six sets of seven to offer a full package of generative adjustment to the client's understanding of their issue.

It follows on from this that clients are offered six sessions of the above.

The Holigral Method looks to work with the client's issues together in parallel to emerge the whole system. Pam states that this is a more efficient model towards and for transcendence. To achieve this, her work involves intensive 7-day facilitated retreats. 

## The Structure of Therapy

If we were to model a collection of therapeutic methods and look to generalise what is occurring for the client in the session, we could isolate some fundamental aspects:

1. What is happening now? - how is the client currently acting and responding to the world?

2. What are the client's needs? - what needs to be resolved?

3. From where and/or whom does the 'problem' come from? - what is the client's history?

4. What will happen in the future? - what are the client's goals or expectations?

	a. What is hindering this future?

	b. What is helping this future?

	c. What is causing this future?

	d. What could stop this future?

The vast variety of tools and techniques that are available to therapists and coaches work with the above structures, along with the requirement for the client to go through an understanding transformation to re-evaluate their experiences in another manner.

The core elements of EK processing are designed to work in all the above structures. Process #2 is designed to shortcut and offer the client direct access to past, present and future, with the necessary re-evaluation.

Re-evaluation comes in many forms through therapy - for instance, in NLP, one may be utilising Sub-modalities or Perceptual Positions to have the client see their problem from another angle or viewpoint. In Clean Language, the use of metaphor is utilised. 

In EK, we utilise a collection of transformations such as space and the relationships developing out of it, iteration, writing and drawing. What guides and holds all of these together are the powerful algorithms, which, when experienced, offer the client multiple opportunities to view and re-evaluate their problem from new perspectives.
