## When Things Pop Up : A Magic Wand

A> This section is a partial revision of Penday's original work on the 'Magic Wand'. Many aspects were so clearly stated that to try to attempt to 're-invent' them would have been futile, so I've simply tidied up and presented this work in alignment with the EK methodology.

Expect, at some point, to see some of the following reactions when running Process #2. This is because it stirs up 'stuff' from the past and the client starts to unknowingly dramatize that stuff. The process can do that, but sometimes it turns on too hard. This can manifest in many different ways:

* Protests
  * *"This is stupid."*
* Objections and complaints
  * *"This isn't working."*
  * *"This won't work."*
  * *"This can't work."*
* Criticisms of the Facilitator
* Any other kind of mis-emotion

All of the above, if not recognised and managed, will interfere with doing the process and can even stop the session, if the facilitator does not see what is happening and correct it.

There are four stages to managing these reactions. Let us explore these in detail.

### Stage 1 - Recognition

The first step is simply noticing that "where the client is now" is no longer where they were when they started the session. The process itself has moved something else in or moved them to a different place.

As a facilitator, you simply need to identify where that new place, feeling, computation, effort, intention, identity or so forth is now. We attempt to handle this 'on the fly', through the reiteration of Step 1 after every set of six time locations. Sometimes this is not enough and the following is required to bring the client's attention to the new shift.

### Stage 2 - Back to Now

Asking the client any kind of question focussed on where the client is now will point to and bring that out. You simply need to get the client to look at what is happening now with their system.

Ask the client something of the order:

* *"And now what is happening?"*
* *"How are you feeling now?"*
* *"And what's going on now?"*

Or use any other similar question that brings their attention to the present and gets them to look at, see, and describe where they are now. This reorients the client to their actual present activity.

Usually, if there is some kind of 'problem', the client will start talking about something else but themselves, which is causing effects. You need to get their attention off what that something else is doing, or might be doing or not, and onto what they are doing.

For example:

* The client is raging at you that:
  * "[a person, condition, etc.]" is causing "[what client doesn't like or is sure to happen in the future, etc.]"
* Enable the client to look at what is happening right now, they may then be able recognise that it's themselves that's raging
  * Ask them, *"And, what is happening right now with you?"*
  * Then, *"And, whereabouts is that?"*

Then you have a new starting point, in a new moment of now. Have the client represent and place this new 'Now' where it belongs.

### Stage 3 - The Magic Wand

Once the client has identified what is happening now, using your understanding that this is coming from somewhere else in the client's past universe, we know it has been stirred up or manifested by the process and simply needs to be addressed.

Make use of the 'Magic Wand' by asking the following question:

* *"Have you ever felt like that before?"* or
* *"And that comes from where?"* or any variation of that simple question

The answer will usually be a resounding "Yes!" and they will tell you all about the past time or place. Have the client represent that and place it where it belongs.

### Stage 4 - Compare

Now you simply proceed as usual, by asking:

C> *"Ok, compare that to now."*

Use this point to start a new round of six again.

### Summary of Intervention

So the entire procedure when something comes up in session is:

* Recognise client is somewhere 'else' now
* Client recognises what is happening now
* Client notices where it comes from
* Client proceeds as normal by comparing to now

'Now?', phrased as in any of the examples above, has the client look at what they are doing now in session, instead of blindly doing it. It is a new Step 1.

'Past?', phrased as *"Have you ever felt like that before?"*, or any other variation appropriate to the client's answer to the 'Now?' question, is simply a variation of *"Where have you been?"* phrased to pick up whatever has just been stirred up by the process.

A final point: in theory, the client might be unable to function because of something from the future that was about to happen. If so, the question after 'Now?' would be *"And where might that happen?"* or similar.
