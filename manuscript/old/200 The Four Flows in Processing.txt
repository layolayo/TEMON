Process Intentions:

#3.This is designed to elicit and explore the client's experience with respect to the fundamental energetic flows between themselves and their current condition. Through this elicitation and exploration, a deeper understanding of these structures emerges.  

#4. has the same intention as #1, with the additional benefit of disconnecting our attention from those distorting memories and beliefs to recover these fragments of attention stuck in our own history. It is a cumulative process, that gets easier and easier with time. As more and more attention is reacquired from these past moments, it becomes available for present time activities.

# Utilisation of the Four Flows

Here we take a brief look at how the Four Fundamental Flows model may be utilised in working with a client or by oneself. We also take a moment to reflect on how a client in session may exhibit these flows, and provide a short description of how the EK methodology is designed to handle these.

## The Four Flows in Session

As a facilitator we should be aware that there may be moments in session when someone responds to a particular memory or situation with a strong tendency towards one of the four flows. Here follows a brief description of potential session responses and how the EK methodology is designed to manage this, hopefully without additional intervention.

### Opposing

* The client is unwilling to accept or see information coming from others and even their own landscape. They could be unwilling to view particular scenes or memories, or accept how a certain situation played out.
* By taking everything at the client's pace, they will view and access information in their own time and way. Iterating through the process, we are simply providing them with multiple opportunities to do so.

### Exposing

* The client has a 'bone to pick': they keep digging in the same place, or for the same expected result - there is 'something to be found here' and they will keep going till they find it. However, they never seem to locate it; they just keep on searching. Client continually keeps going back to the same area, as if searching for something, but never appears to recognise what is there.
* As the client writes up and places papers for each past moment, future and aspect, they steadily become aware of the imbalance, and that their search in this area has become fruitless.

### Concealing

* The client may be suppressing emotions or ideas, as they don't want anyone to know what is happening within them or to them. They access a memory or idea, but withhold the information, as they have a particular feeling or belief about sharing it that they don't want to experience.
* The memory/idea is not the issue; it may actually be the source of that 'particular feeling/belief', or the response they are experiencing by considering what would happen if they exposed this information, that holds the key to resolution. Utilisation of the 'Magic Wand' technique can bring the client to acknowledge what is happening right now for them, and then locating where that comes from.

### Imposing

* Client talks incessantly about a particular subject. The client is persistent in making their point, there is a constant stream of information to make sure that the facilitator is aware of the client's position or state of being, etc. Client can become forthright in their language and behaviour.
* Having the client write up and place a paper for each iteration has the effect of allowing the client to become aware of how much attention they are giving to this particular subject in comparison to everything else. Having the client stop and write down their responses, i.e. a translation, interrupts the client's verbal impose pattern.
