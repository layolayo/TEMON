# Process #1 - Emerging Moving

This process is an adapted version of Pam Saunders original from the Holigral training manual and her book, 'The Emperorâ€™s New Psychology'.

It can be run by a facilitator or by oneself. The purpose of this process is to orientate the client's attention to the present moment in time.

## Introduction

If you run this on your own and find you have little change or effect, get someone else to ask you the questions. It has been noticed by some people that they can become 'intellectual' about the responses and look to calculate answers. Process #1 is experiential: feel it - just voice what is occurring in your thinking and your body as it is happening.

When you start, if you don't have a presenting issue to attend to, focus on a bodily sensation and follow the changes this goes through as the questions drive your system.

It is extremely simple and effective.

It works exceptionally well when you **'walk and talk'**, so get up, move around and verbalise the answer to each question. 

In fact, Pam states that "It is *ultra-important* to be walking, because the process is left-right footed."

## And, now what is happening?

Client starts the session with an issue, desire or body sensation in mind to attend to.

Ask the client each question in turn, then continue to repeat steps 2 and 3, until the client expresses a positive shift in their well-being or presenting issue.

1. *"And, now what is happening?"*
2. *"And, as that is happening, now what happens?"*
3. *"And, as that happens, now what is happening?"*

## An Analysis of Process #1

The iterative function of the two questions facilitates the client's system and enables change to occur. Their system begins to take on motion, so, where previously ideas or physical feelings were stuck, they now have an opportunity to flow again.

Once the system is in flow, the repeated questioning brings rhythm and pacing to the system, and the client begins to recognise they are existing in the moment of now, and their experience is an open flow.

This process is an absolute gem, the simplicity of it is a work of genius.

Given the time and attention, it can have great beneficial effects - be aware that this process may also require some additional skills and intervention to facilitate fully, this is where training and experience are key.

The included transcript shows how such a simple process can evolve into a multi-layered structure sometimes requiring some additional advanced techniques. This added complexity comes from the client and is acknowledged by the facilitator through these deviations.

Success may also be achieved in the use of this process as it is, without any additional devitation.

### History of Process #1

This process was developed from Pam's understanding of the human mind, where one aspect is coded in fixed, locational thinking and another in fluid, momentum thinking. The two-question structures move between these.

* locational - "Now what happens?"
* momentum - "Now what is happening?"

This iterative transition between the two structures is designed to bring balance to both aspects and thus the client's presenting issue. Pam describes the original metaphor for the process as, 'to turn something static to something moving so that it could flow away, leaving a person in the now.'
