Now you have some experience of using Clean Space and the Iterative Patterns of Emergence through these processes, you will be beginning to develop a connection to your internal navigator. You may now be wondering what happens next?

## New Processes and the Future

Many other Emergent processes have been developed over the intervening years. My work with David was based on breaking down each stage of an EK process into a specific unit. This has now provided us with a collection of units, which it is possible to connect together in an infinite variety of ways. The benefit of this is that new processes may be designed and expressed using this terminology.

As well as the original processes, a selection of new Emergent approaches have been developed by myself. Some of these can be experienced on the Powers of Six website, others are delivered in training courses and will also be presented in the follow-up book in the near future.

More processes from The Holigral Method may initially be discovered from Pam's book, "The Emperor's New Psychology". For more details on training or facilitation in this method, please contact Pam direct through her website: <http://www.holigral.com>

I have presented another of Pam's original processes, 'The Issue Buster', on the Powers of Six website where it can be experienced in full using the online Iterator. Other notable processes Pam has developed are: The Space In-Between, Re-Scaling, Story-Busting and Pronoun-Scaling.

As more research occurs, new ideas and techniques are being developed. This is a vibrant field with a vast scope of growth and evolution available.
