# Appendix 3 - A Set of Brief Histories

As stated in the beginning my understanding and experience of EK would not be what it is without the open and generous gifts given to me from David and Pam. Here follows a brief outline of their histories and the time they spent together. Over the years many people have had an influence on the development of EK, it appears this was David's way, he would connect with others and cybernetically transfer the learning from outside professions into the work he was doing at the time.

My focus on Pam and her developments in this book is due to our close connection and the work we have done together. I do not intend this piece to infer that others were not also contributing to David's understanding and development of EK, for this is not the case. James Lawley and Penny Tompkins, Shaun Hotchkiss, Cei Davies Linn, Caitlin Walker, Carol Wilson, John Farrell, Philip Harland, Steven Briggs, Bill Rawlin are only some of the names that have also had a direct influence, my apologies if I have missed any names of notable importance.

Following these brief histories is my short memoir from meeting David up to the present time (2019).

## Histories

### David Grove

C> Ernest Rossi

***

David was born in New Zealand of Maori and European ancestry. He graduated in zoology at the University of Canterbury in 1972, and gained an MBA from Otago University in 1973. His professional development as a counselling psychologist included a degree in Counselling from the State University of Minnesota and a study of Ericksonian Hypnosis and a short encounter with NLP.

In the 1980's he developed Clean Language as a response to clients' subjective experiences of phobias and trauma. This methodology is a set of simple, yet powerful questions that help clients fully explore and develop their personal metaphors for their experience. As the client develops and learns more about their metaphoric world(s), the metaphor typically begins to modify of its own accord, resulting in the relief or resolution of the problem. This was David's initial creation and set him up to become one of the world's most innovative therapists.

He and Cei, David's wife at the time, continued to evolve and develop their ideas in their Healing the Wounded Child Within programme and Therapeutic Metaphor work. This then culminated in a revolutionary shift in his approach, David began to have the client utilise the space around them and explore their relationship to it. It was here that he further developed the patterning of sixes, discovered by Bill Rawlin (David's mentor), that would eventually become the foundation of Emergent Knowledge.

David travelled the world sharing his work with thousands of therapists and those interested in change work, who in turn after falling in love with Clean Language and this idea or philosophy of Clean, began to share and train the material themselves.

Pam is a chartered engineer and a physicist. In her earlier life she'd worked on developing military radar systems for the UK Government, though by 2003 she had moved out of this field and had begun her own research and developments into the human mind, trauma and the nature of association and dissociation. This was the same set of ideas and questions that David was asking and working on at the time and therefore became the catalyst for bringing David and Pam to work together.

This happened in July 2005 when Steven was hosting his second Integral NLP Conference, which included several Clean Language presenters. Although David was not presenting he was in attendance. Here began what was to be 18 months of collaboration and development work together.

David continued working and presenting with other people during this period - see the Clean Language website for articles and information on his other collaborations - his close collaboration with Steven was in continuing to develop the principles and processes of Emergent Knowledge.

### An Emergent Collaboration

David was now living and working from Steven and Josie's home in Glastonbury, their collaboration and co-developments at this time furthered the development of Emergent Knowledge, such as recognising that the emergent patterns were fractal in nature, and recognising that David's existing Clean Space work actually operated in all 3D planes, this sparked a chain of events and developments to bring the use of the 'Whirly-Gig' for therapeutic interventions into being.

The 'Whirly-Gig' is a large three-ringed device with a harnessed seat positioned in the centre ring. The rings are connected together with full 360 degree rotational pivot points. Which allows the person sat in the seat to completely move in all 3 dimensions. This is all controlled by a facilitator and an assistant moving and supporting the rings by hand.

David was using this machine to aid the client in reclaiming and accessing memories of their prior defining moments. There is a significant amount of technical information around how and why the 'Whirly-Gig' achieves this, though I will only summarise here that the use of the machine provides a mechanism that may begin to align the client to the original spatial positioning and measurement of their moment of trauma. 

![David facilitating a client on the Whirly-Gig (France 2007)](images/whirlygig-comp.jpg)

David's theory of dissociation states that an aspect of self (The Wounded Child) metaphorically leaves the body and is transferred into the locus of where the client's attention was at the time of the trauma. Re-aligning the client to the same direction, azimuth and body position in the present time aids in re-opening this 'portal' for the recovery of this aspect, it is said that this aspect had become 'frozen in time'. This is termed 'Explosive fragmentation'. There is also 'Implosive fragmentation', where the attention goes inside a body part.

In December 2006 the collaboration between David and Steven broke down and they separated ways. Steven continued to work on developing his own processes and theoretical models now known as 'The Holigral Method', David focused on defining and developing the core principles of Emergent Knowledge along with his own set of processes.

## Memoir

### My Connection with David and Pam

Around the same time of this separation, I had begun furthering my own training and development in NLP on my Masters course in Newcastle. It was here I was introduced to Clean Language by Caitlin Walker. I was immediately hooked, the philosophy of Clean resonated within me. 

It was now 2007, and David was living and working from Caitlin and Shaun Hotchkiss' home. Even though he was working closely with Shaun at this time, he was looking for someone to directly work alongside him to assist in modelling and cataloguing his latest work and developments in Emergent Knowledge.

Due to my circumstances at the time, I had the honour of Caitlin proposing this opportunity to myself, and I began working with David in the latter part of 2007. Here began a journey of discovery that would form the kernel of my development and work for the next 12 years (and, it still appears at this time, well beyond this!). 

We spent some time together in Liverpool (UK) to discuss how we would be working, along with specifying the intended end goals of our working relationship.

Our first step on this adventure was to drive to France and record David's presentations and training that were lined up there at Jennifer de Gandt's beautiful home and training centre in La Bouveti√®re, Normandy.

David and I then spent our time in France, where, in between his training and therapy sessions, we began to codify his Emergent Knowledge patterns into a format that was to be universally transferable. My technical experience in digital networking systems aligned perfectly with the work David was presenting at the time. Thus the networking and data transfer metaphors and terminology became part of this formatting.

At the end of 2007, he left for the United States, and we remained in contact, discussing his projects and what would happen on his return. Unfortunately, in January 2008, I received a call from Steven Saunders to inform me that David had died of a heart attack. On hearing this terrible news I knew that the work we had done together up to that point could not lie dormant on my PC and in my notebooks. 

### On the Loss of David

During our time in France, I'd been introduced to Philip Harland where we had discussed at length his project of writing a book on David's patterning of 'Six'. On reconnecting with Philip the ideal opportunity to share our experience and knowledge opened up, together we produced the Powers of Six website <http://www.powersofsix.com> to share some of the fundamentals of my work with David and his own, along with the additional intention of promoting Philip's upcoming book of the same title. 

We co-wrote and published several articles together in ReSource magazine and also co-presented a session on The Iterative Pattern of Emergence at the first Clean Conference in June 2008 - 'Roots and Fruits of Emergent Knowledge - The Joy of Six!' 

At this conference I attended a short practical session on Emergence presented by Steven down in the depths of the Quaker building. This session was attended by three people, myself, Steven and another guest. I accepted the offer of having Steven run a short Emergent process on me to show the use of iteration and a Clean Space 'Turning' technique. This session brought me to a previously unknown memory (a defining moment) of being about 9 months old in a cot. 

This Wounded Child recovery had a deep impact on my sense of self and it took several months for my system to settle down; however, the shift and recovery placed me in a very different and interesting space (see, [Emergence](#emergence) a poem I wrote on the day.)

Nine months later in March 2009, I attended a Holigral retreat in Cornwall where Steven unveiled his own fully redesigned 'Whirly-Gig'. He had removed the rather dangerous operation of using three-rings down to a much safer single-ring and, through an ingenious engineering design of how all three planes of rotation work, its new design maintained all six degrees of freedom. This machine is known as 'The Ark-Angle David'. 

![The Ark-Angle David](images/arkangle.jpg)

My passion for sharing and evolving the knowledge I had received from David and Steven has never diminished. The Powers of Six website was further developed to include a self-processing feature called 'The Iterator', where visitors are able to explore an issue through the application of some basic and more advanced EK processes through a private online interface. This also provided me with a platform to develop and evolve my own projects and processes.

In parallel with the Powers of Six site I created the website <http://www.self-alignment.com> to offer a more thorough description of Grovian Emergent Knowledge as David and I had formulated it, along with an intensive 7-day personal journey process which was created out of the final material that David was presenting prior to his death.

I have ventured into several experimental projects over the years such as creating the board game 'And...', with its associated website <http://www.gameofstories.com>. These fun and interesting side projects pop up every now and again as connections are made.

During all of this time, I have trained and utilised the models of Emergence with students and clients.

### Coming up to Present Time

In 2015 Steven decided to transition, to become Pam Saunders, integrating her full feminine self into her working, home and social life.

Sadly, in 2016 Philip Harland and I couldn't come to an agreement about how the Powers of Six website would be managed and we settled this partnership. I still own and continue to maintain and develop the Powers of Six website with new processes, articles and videos. It is my intention that this material, and that provided on Self-Alignment, will always be free to access, and may be shared and developed upon under the Open Source philosophy.

On 8th January 2018, I was gifted the opportunity to talk about my time with David at a beautiful online event *'Remembering David Grove'*, celebrating his life, 10 years after we lost him. The recording of this event is available at www.facebook.com/RememberingDavidGrove/videos

This book is my first in offering my own developments and interpretations of what I have learned from David and Pam. I am gracious of this gift. I'm fortunate to be able to share this with you.
