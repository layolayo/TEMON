# Redefining the Iterative Pattern

This chapter provides a deeper analysis of the Iterative Pattern of Emergence, also known as The Power of Six. We take a revised look at what the pattern is, its structure and also review this with client transcripts.

## The Pattern Revised

I have observed and utilised the 'Iterative Pattern of Emergence' countless times since being introduced to this by David in 2007. The pattern came from David's understanding at the time and it was still a work in progress. Once the pattern was recognised, it was observed, and proposed that we were all subject to this pattern. In this way, it has been considered that the pattern is mystical or spiritual in nature - including myself at times.

So I have researched many avenues to gain some deeper understanding and comprehension as to why this would be so, especially with so many cultures experiencing the same patterning.

I have come to the conclusion that the pattern is as it is, not because of some ancient imprint (although Pam Saunders has spotted there is a very interesting and conspicuous link to the seven days of the week - this is detailed in [Appendix 2](#appendix2)), but simply because this is the structure and nature of our awareness expanding. Each stage logically proceeds from the one preceding it; once a stage is reached you cannot backtrack to now not knowing! Therefore, there is only going forward and, ultimately, passing through this pattern.

Taking the logical approach, the expression of this pattern is validated as we look at how one's awareness naturally expands:

* Once one becomes aware of something, we are then open to recognising more aspects and then how these aspects inter-relate.
* One is now at the point where one may become aware of those aspects that are not immediately associated, but which also run contra to the aspects already unveiled.
* At this point a re-analysis is required to discover how all these concepts can exist at once. To achieve this, a revision of the current set of rules and boundaries is required, and this begins with the deconstruction of the existing structure.
* Now a new set of rules and boundaries may be developed which can envelope all that is now observed and known about.

The basic elements of this pattern may be observed in the Hegelian Dialectic.

Where there are three dialectical stages of development: 

1. A thesis (Stages 1-3)
2. An anti-thesis (Stage 4: The Wobble) which contradicts the thesis
3. The synthesis (Stages 5 & 6) which is the result of the reconciliation of these two

All of which drives towards a new understanding, which we now call Emergence. This process may continue indefinitely, see overleaf.

We may also observe it within the scientific method:

### The Seven Stages of Emergence

This new understanding has led me to review the pattern and offer an updated set of constructs. Note that the underlying structure remains the same.

1 - *Recognition*: We begin with the client *recognising* and making an initial statement about their issue - This is the first stage, we now accept this stage to be synonymous with David's beginning stage where he has the client write up on paper what it is they would like to work on.

2 - *Effect*: In the second stage, the client provides us with an explanation of what is happening and perhaps how this issue is *effecting* them.

3 - *System and Form*: Moving on from these effects, the client begins their exploration of how this occurs. What is the operation of the world in which they operate? What is the *system*? It is here that the client will provide us with the boundary conditions - that which defines the *form*. It is here where we will be introduced to the rules, ultimatums and required conditions.

4 - *Consequences and Contradictions*: As the client progresses, they push forward and offer up what happens as a result of this system, these are the *consequences*. The facilitator now waits... for the client may spend a little time here before offering *contradictory* information, maybe mentioning what it is like when the problem isn't there or what it was like in the past before they had this problem.

5 - *Unravel*: Once the client has stated this contradictory information, then observed this in relationship to the consequences and the information from the first four stages, it becomes apparent that the original form and structure of the client's system is now no longer valid. This then must start to *unravel*. After this has occurred, the information leftover has the opportunity to come together. This we call the unification and is part of the next stage.

6 - *Emergence*: On coming to this point of a unification, the client's system re-evaluates, the result of which then appears in consciousness. Usually surprising the client - the new rules and boundary conditions that evolve here are what we call *Emergence*. This effect provides a reference to how we cannot go back to 'the way things were' for that time has now passed. We may only recover from and learn to live in acceptance, experiencing a new world that encompasses our whole time track, in a holistic manner, thus the final stage.

7 - *Rest and Consolidation*: Now that the client has a new world-view, they reflect on it and how it all relates back to themselves. This is just like in David's original patterning: it is a stage of *rest* where there is a *consolidation* of the new information and the client.

## A Client's Process

To aid in sharing this updated patterning with you, I will use a client's responses from their self managed process from the online Iterator at <http://www.powersofsix.com>.

In order to do this each of the client's responses are presented at list position (a.), along with a short description of how this response relates to that stage in the process below it at list position (b.)

The process being run was the "Full Six Steps" process devised by David and implemented into the Iterator by myself.

Our client, who we'll call Walter, starts their process writing down what they'd like to work on and is then iteratively asked,

C> *"And, what (else) do you know about that?"*

1. *Recognition* - validating 'B' exists
	a. Weight-Money-Work. Why is being at a healthy weight a lifelong struggle? Why does it always feel that having enough money is a struggle? Why do I tend to dislike the work I do?
	b. Here's the first statement - Walter is beginning his process and exposes that which has been holding his attention. His questions and personal responses are simply stated as he currently understands them. The problem is *Recognised*.
2. *Effect* - validating the relationship between 'A' and 'B'
	a. Weight, money and work are three areas that I am most unhappy about in my life.
	b. Walter's statement that *'..I am most unhappy about..'*, is representative of showing what happens to Walter with respect to his issue at Stage 1 - very much an *Effect*.
3. *System & Form* - looking at the structure of the world of 'A' and 'B' which is 'C'
	a. They seem to be interconnected - I eat too much when I am stressed about money or work. My work does not generate enough money. I do not have enough money to do the things that I would like.
	b. Walter is starting to look at the structure of his issue and himself. The idea of the *'seem to be interconnected'* tends towards us considering that Walter is now beginning to look at his issue as a *system*. See how the separate aspects of the system are now affecting the others.
4. *Consequences & Contradictions* - the repercussions and also the inverse of 'B' in 'D' = '!B'
	a. I am wondering why I keep these as problems.
	b. Stage 4 usually brings consequences initially, then contradictions follow. For Walter we can see that only the *consequences* of recognising Stage 3 are exposed. He is questioning himself as to why he is keeping these as problems. Recall from 'The Wobble', that the facilitator should wait for the doubt. The same applies here. If facilitating, allow the client time to discover the contradictions. 
5. *Unravel* - the disentanglement or collapse of 'C', following up with the synthesis of 'B' and '!B'
	a. I do not know what connects them - but I am sure there is a root cause. Something at the bottom that ties them together
	b. Something *'connects'* all these elements, and for this to be true Walter is *'sure there is a root cause'*. If we consider that this statement is the moment that the boundary of C *unravels*, then Walter is now able to re-associate all this information.
6. *Emergence* - the new set of structures to allow Stage 5 to exist
	a. Work seems to be fraught with disharmony. I dislike the politics. I would like for us to focus on the goal. Disharmony is at the root - when I feel out of sync, then I eat, stress about money and work
	b. Notice that we now have new information and a new viewpoint on the original issue - where has *'fraught with disharmony'* suddenly come from? Walter can also see that this has now to do with *'politics'*, as well as discovering what it is he would like. He then moves on to recognise that the *'unknown'* and *'don't know'* from Stages 3 and 4 is *'Disharmony is at the root'*. He finishes off with how all of this fits together and completes by reiterating his original construct of the system.
7. *Rest & Consolidation* - integration of this change
	a. Disharmony means that things are not working smoothly. It means that there is a risk of an emotional blow up. I want to avoid people blowing up - as I feel obligated to make it better for them. I need to make it OK
	b. Walter now expresses the meaning of what has just occurred. This is a higher level appreciation of his experience. We are also introduced to another level of Walter's situation which was not available previously, what else he wants and the structure of this.
	He wants *'to avoid people blowing up'*. There is also recognition of a not previously expressed structure of rules *'I feel obligated to make it better for them'*, *'I need to make it OK'*.

That concludes a full round of 7 stages.

We now begin again. Note that with this next series of questions the client looks at the reverse flow from issue to client,

C> *"And what (else) does that know about you?"*

Though, the first question Walter starts with on the second round is:

C> *"And what do you know now?"*

This offers him a new and fresh look at his issue:

1. *Recognition*
	a. That it is tied to disharmony and my need to make things OK for other people.
	b. Here we have a neat summary of what Walter stated in his last round.
2. *Effect*
	a. That I am scared of disharmony. Probably terrified of it.
	b. Walter is clearly making a statement of the effect this has on him.
3. *System & Form*
	a. His fear is being attacked and hurt. He wants to control the situation so that there is minimal risk. He wants to make sure people are OK.
	b. Notice that Walter has flipped his viewpoint here and is now referring to himself as a separate identity, the question structure can elicit this. Analysis of Walter's response again shows that this stage has the client looking at the context and the structures that hold the issue in place. For Walter this is noticing that it is his *'fear'* which *'is being attacked and hurt'* and the requirement for *'control'*. His requirement *'to make sure people are OK'* is reiterated.
4. *Consequence & Contradiction*
	a. That he spends a lot of energy trying to prevent "bad" things from happening, instead of working to create good or better.
	b. Walter begins his answer with a consequence - *'he spends a lot of energy trying to prevent bad things'* - after which Walter presents the contradiction: *'working to create good or better.'* Here is a new part to the system. We can consider that this has appeared at the boundary of C, entering in from D - the Potential Space. Notice that the inverse of *'prevent bad'* is *'create good'*.
5. *Unravel*
	a. That he is totally controlled by others - what do they think about his weight? What they expect from him. He has totally vacated the ownership position, and is trying to figure out what others need.
	b. Walter continues to bring in contradictions - previously in Stage 3 it was him that was wanting control, now we see that it is others that control him. This is about *'what they expect from him'* and that he has vacated the *'ownership position'*. This position has not been mentioned previously; is this vacation recognition of the unravelling? The questioning and confusions here are common in the 5th stage.
6. *Emergence*
	a. Controlling the uncontrollable is a losing proposition. People cannot be controlled. They will do things that may or may not be supportive. In the end, the focus is not where it needs to be.
	b. The statements made here are the restructuring of 'C'. These are firm concepts - *'Controlling the uncontrollable is a losing proposition'*, *'People cannot be controlled'*. Although these ideas may appear to have a negative slant, Walter's ideas about what is happening here have shifted; this is no longer about control, it's about focus. He finishes off with what needs to be addressed next.
7. *Rest & Consolidation*
	a. That his focus is on what other people want instead of what he wants. Instead of finding what he wants, he tries to justify everything, saying he could create it where he is. He is afraid of change.
	b. And now, Walter provides the consolidation and deeper meaning to the information that came out of Stage 6. Yet again, he finishes off with some new information: *'He is afraid of change'*.

From this short transcript we can see that each question stimulated our client into the next stage of awareness, but do not think that it is simply just the iteration of a question that does this (although this does offer benefit).

The facilitator's ability to spot where the client is, and time the delivery of the next question, is also very important to the success of Emergent Knowledge processing. Note that in the above transcript, facilitator input was not possible as it was run without facilitation via an online platform.

## It's all about the Sequence

A> *"All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return"*
A>
A> Syd Barrett (Pink Floyd) lyrics to Chapter 24

You may have noticed in Stage 7 of the second round in Walter's process that information was still emerging out of the consolidation stage; here we look at how this occurs.

The power to be utilised in the pattern is not in the numbers, but in the sequencing - it is this that drives the expansion of one's awareness to allow the mind to make sense of the problem or issue in another way.

This sequence is a neat description of the phases or stages of developing human awareness.

The purpose of the iteration is to move one's attention through these stages. The stages are not digital in nature, one doesn't instantly switch from one to another. Our attention responds more like a wave - for example, maybe it is currently in stage 4 with hints of 3 remaining and aspects of 5 rising. Sometimes the wave doesn't rise and fall at all, as the information gathered is not yet enough to stimulate a stage 5 deconstruction.

{pagebreak}

Continuing with this metaphor, observe the stages of a wave breaking and reaching the shoreline aligned with our six stages:

![Stages of Wave Formation](images/Waves.png)

We can imagine that the **Capillary Waves** (also known as ripples) are those initiated in the first three stages - thus these are the usual 'ripples of life', now consider that the client's attention is the **wave direction** and the iteration of the process provides the **wind**, it is necessary for both of these to be aligned in the same direction.

In stage 4 the client's system begins to shift and wobble, here **Gravity Waves** are generated; in oceanology these are waves that result when fluid is displaced from a position of equilibrium. This reflects what is happening for our client in the 'wobble' of stage 4. In stage 5, their system has culminated into a **Whitecap**, a breaking wave, and once this wave breaks (the Collapse/Unravelling), we move into stage 6, where the wave in its wake leaves behind on the shoreline some gift from the sea of the unconsciousness.

## Summary of Revised Pattern

In summary, the revised naming of the stages are:

1. Recognition
2. Effect
3. System and Form
4. Consequence and Contradiction
5. Unravel
6. Emergence
7. Rest and Consolidation

The first letter of each stage provides us with a relative and useful acronym: RESCUER to help us remember each stage.
 
Another book will be published offering a deeper explanation into the above pattern and where it leads to after the 7th stage. I have now categorised another 14 stages, offering us:

C> **21 Stages of Emergence**

## Another Client Transcript

Here follows a short transcript from another client. 

X> ### Exercise
X>
X>Read through this and note down the moments when you consider the client passes through each stage of their developing awareness.

1 - **Type into the box what you would like to work on:**
repeated addictive behaviour patterns. I would like to stop doing them.

2 - **What do you know about that?**
I have had compulsive types of behaviour for a long time, whether it has been food, tobacco, gaming, or checking the internet. I am aware that the behaviour keeps changing form. Whenever I change one behaviour, recently eating, I replace it with another (gaming) and have then swapped them again. The behaviour is healthier now than it has been, and yet at its core it remains the same break in concentration and activity to do something else.

3 - **And what else do you know about that?**
I get a feeling in my chest which is quite sad and uncomfortable writing about it. I sometimes feel that I am in control and making choices myself and at other times experience it as something that I know is going to happen and may as well give up and let it happen. It is this which is often a trigger for change. I am frustrated writing this because I got a response to the trigger for change sentence which was a little bit hopeless. Slight urge to cry appeared in my left eye

4 - **And what else do you know about that?**
I get scared, don't want to end up like my mum, or my dad. I think too much, it may be that it helps me distract my head. Or not, I don't actually know. I am in the behaviour prison, keeping on building the walls and bars, not knowing what else to do.

5 - **And what else do you know about that?**
I seem to refuse to believe that it could be as simple as stopping building the prison: could I really be so stupid that I have spent years doing something which was in reality pointless? I like solving puzzles and challenging my brain, and I am building a prison again! I want to both laugh and cry about how fucking ridiculous all of this is! I get a really good feeling about having found something to do instead and yet I know that it is just another iteration of the prison.

6 - **And what else do you know about that?**
It feels like I am banging my head against a brick wall trying to find a solution, it hurts, and every now and again I change wall, or put something soft in the way, and then keep on banging. I keep saying that no one is stupid, but this behaviour is. Or is it just being human, and then I am negotiating again. I tell myself I should stop doing it, and currently find softer walls, but the headbanging continues.

7 - **And what else do you know about that?**
The uncomfortable feeling in my stomach increases with each question, as does the sadness, mostly around the eyes. It feels like the questions themselves are becoming a type of headbanging, reminding myself that I don't know the way to stop. The discomfort is why I want to stop, and that goes away quickly, so I start again...

8 - **And now what do you know?**
I need help to find better questions and explore better solutions than headbanging.

9 - **And what is the difference between what you knew at the start and what you know now?**
The feeling associated with headbanging is mostly in the stomach and guts, and it is a feeling of fear and inadequacy. I can't solve this one on my own, need to try something different. Or find something soft to hit my head on.

### Patterning the Second Transcript

Here follows a brief outline structure to the above transcript relating to the Emergent pattern. Check this against your own notes.

1. Recognition - In the first statement the client simply states their recognition of the issue: *'repeated addictive behaviour patterns. I would like to stop doing them.'*
2. Effect - From the second statement, *'I change one behaviour, recently eating, I replace it with another'*, this can be seen as an explanation of the effect upon the client. As the client moves into the third statement, they are offering more effects upon themselves, with, *'I get a feeling in my chest..'* and *'I sometimes feel that I am in control...'*
3. System and Form - They then begin to bring form and structure to this, with, *'It is this which is often a trigger for change'*. They then finish off the third statement with more Effect, although this may also be part of the Consequences stage.
4. Consequences and Contradictions - The fourth statement provides us with, *'I get scared ...'*, *'I think too much ...'* These are the consequences of what has come so far. Then we get *'Or not'*, where the client now gets confused, *'I don't actually know'*, and then begins to offer the alternatives with references to a *'behaviour prison'* where they are *'building walls and bars, not knowing what else to do.'* This idea is structurally different in that this is something the client is actually doing and not something that is being done only with their consent. This would fit in with being a contradiction.
5. Unravel - In the fifth statement we witness the unravelling, *'I seem to refuse to believe that it could be as simple as stopping building the prison'*. Both structures then begin to come together, *'Could I really be so stupid that I have spent years doing something which was in reality pointless?'*. Recall from the previous section that the client during the Unravelling step may become confused and question what has been happening. Of additional interest here is the dual contradiction of *"I want to both laugh and cry"*
6. Emergence - The client's idea of banging their head against the wall becomes apparent in their sixth statement, they are starting to restructure their model. With this comes thinking and questioning to test ideas and how things feel. This aspect of the process can be seen as the client works with what is happening to them in the moment. As they move into the seventh statement, they are bringing more attention onto *'headbanging'* and the structure of how this operates.
7. Rest - On the seventh statement the client is embodying the processing from stages #1 to #6 and acknowledges the structure of what is happening to them. 

This transcript shows us how the stages of emergence can pass over into pre and post questions.

The patterning may also bring out the deeper symptoms. There is good evidence above to show that the headbanging and the associated feelings which have emerged in the client's system from the iterative questioning are within this category.

You can see that at question #8, which in a larger scale process would actually be utilised as a new #1 for the next set of questions, the client is providing the groundwork for the next stage in their journey.
