# Process #1 - Example Session (Carl)

Here I present a live session transcript of running Process #1. Carl came to me with a presenting issue that meant he had great difficulty in travelling, he had a fear of bridges whether walking across them or driving.

We visited a footbridge close by and ran the following session, I utilised the therapeutic technique of EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) along with the EK question set, Carl tapped on a new EFT point for every question asked. You will see that I step outside of a strict adherence to the basic algorithm, this is due to several reasons:

1. The client began repeating some effects
2. To maintain a set of questions in line with the 8 EFT tapping points (so rounds are 7[+1] here)

To show this the transcript is shown in sets of Iterations. When I do step outside the algorithm, I utilise some of the original Clean Language questions to elicit more detail on aspects that are repeated by Carl.

We start the transcript as Carl and I, walk up to the bridge. 

## Live Transcript of Process #1

### First Iteration 

*And now what is happening?*

I'm becoming a bit apprehensive, slowing down a bit. Looking at it I'm thinking it's quite high. [Carl takes his first step onto the bridge]

I don't particularly like the look of it and the more I get out onto it, the more that feeling comes over me. [Carl steps back off the bridge]

My left leg is starting to go, my fists were both starting to clench, I was realising how high the bridge is and noticed the high sides of it. Theoretically I know I cannot fall over the sides, but my mind is saying "It's still not fully enclosed", it is worrying. I was starting to feel waves of worry and anxiety come over me.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I'm starting to feel calmer about the whole situation, the state I was in wasn't doing me any favours.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I still don't feel like getting close to it, and my left leg... it feels really quite tense.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

It still feels quite tense.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I feel rigid in my entire body.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

My mouth has gone a bit dry.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I can feel myself tapping under my arm, it's all changed to that.

*What do you know now about all of this?*

[Carl doesn't speak, he starts to walk out onto the bridge.]

### Second Iteration 

[There are no words for this iteration, as Carl walks out we simply move through the standard EFT points with no questions, he gets so far then physically clenches up and expresses a sound of discomfort, turns and walks rapidly off the bridge]

### Third Iteration 

*And now what is happening?*

I just wanted to get off it, it was almost as if I was getting to a point I couldn't physically walk, like something was stopping me.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

It's weird, because I got out there without any problem, and then like something instantaneously went 'Woomfph' and then a force field stop.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

My legs have gone all funny again.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

My left hand is clenching.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

It's starting to go through my head that I don't need to get across this bridge, so what's the point in even trying.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I'm thinking, there's no way I can slip under this, I would have to do a massive jump to jump over the sides.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I don't know what it is about it (the bridge), but I'm getting a real sense of worry about it.

*What do you know now about all of this?*

[Carl begins to walk back out across the bridge]

### Fourth Iteration 

*And now what is happening?*

It's in my legs, they are starting to feel heavy and also across here in my face.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I've got dry lips and a dry mouth.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

Part of me is saying, "Why can't you just walk across the bridge, it's just a bridge it's like walking on a path. It's a path."

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I've got tension back in my leg, it's in both legs but in my left more than my right.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I'm starting to feel tight.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

It's in my wrists.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

Oh! There's a wave coming over me.

[Carl rapidly walks back off the bridge.]

*What do you know now about all of this?* 

*[This question was missed as the 'wave' was investigated instead.]*

### Fifth Iteration
*[Carl has now spoken of the 'wave' and 'Woomfph' several times and during the process he has also physically represented it using his arms. I take this opportunity to investigate a little deeper with a Clean Language question.]*

*And where could that 'wave' come from?*

It came from my mind, when I was looking at that (over the sides of the bridge). I established how far down it is from top to bottom and I thought "Oooo, it might not be safe".

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

There's part of me that wants to start walking over that bridge, but then I visualise myself doing it and I get met by this force field that stops me.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I feel almost rooted to the spot, as if it is trying to protect me.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I'm scanning the bridge with my eyes. Scanning it, thinking "What is it, 40 yards to the other side?" So I'm having an internal argument of "Well, it's 40 yards, but you don't have to do it, so don't do it."

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I feel uncomfortable about this bridge. It's all over me, it's like half a centimeter all around. It's now filled with peace, that Ready Brek glow around me, it's as though the peace side of it was slightly more than the fear bit.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I'm starting to feel lightheaded and sick. I don't feel like I'm going to be sick; but my tummy is going 'woah woah'.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

It feels so trivial, that guy has just come across it on a skateboard - and then there's this nervous energy.

*And what do you know now about all of this?*

That there is something stopping me from going across it and quite frankly that is ridiculous, because ultimately the bridge itself is perfectly safe, there are sides on it so you can't just accidently fall off the side and you can't slip and go underneath it. But there is something about it, and I just don't want to go across it.

Why is that? It's a bridge across a road, a little gorge. But I just feel there is no way I can go across it. I've walked out there a few times, but now I cannot even get on to the opening.

### Sixth Iteration

*And now what is happening?*

I have these bizarre things, like if I'm in a meeting and my mind starts to drift I might get an impulse or a compulsion to go "What would happen if I punched that fella there?" Not in any way wanting to hurt that fella or even do it. My mind starts going through these scenarios because it's almost like an impulse or a compulsion and right now I'm looking at this and I'm thinking "Right, there's no way I'm going to jump over that bridge, but what would happen if I got to the middle and had an impulse or a compulsion to jump over the side of the bridge?"

And that's interesting as that has reminded me of walking across bridges, because I always put my mobile phone in my pocket, because if it was in my hand I could have the impulse to just throw it over the side.

It's a worry, that I am going to do something that I won't be able to control.

The situation itself, if you look at it from a risk assessment perspective, my Dad worked for the Health and Safety Executive (Carl laughs), it's pretty low-risk, without any outside external force it is completely no-risk. The only risk is if I couldn't control myself jumping over the side, and there is no reason I would jump over the side. So I should just be able to walk across it. 

[Carl then begins to walk out onto the bridge, after a few steps he mutters 'ya ya ya']

*[This next step is an advanced technique within the Emergent Knowledge methodology, it is based on the principle that the client's symptoms are unsuccessful attempts by the mind and body to heal itself. This next question is designed to encourage the symptom to further reveal itself. It's place within the current context may also begin to emerge.]* 

*And what does that 'ya ya ya' know?*

It's like this ridiculously strong force field, this fear and the start of something that will black me out or make me faint or do something that... it's the fear of losing control. That's what it is. Like the fear of having a panic attack. My hands feel clammy but dry..? This is weird, I've never had that before.

*And whereabouts is that 'fear of losing control'?*

It's like a huge thing pressing down on me, wanting to push me onto the floor. And I refuse to be pushed to the floor so I push back and then have to leave the situation.

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

It's not there now.

[Carl walks back onto the bridge, he breathes heavily and emits a deep 'Whoooahhh', then turns and gets off the bridge]

I had to get off quick. That was the wave, that's the quickest it's ever come on, everything felt fine and then 'Shuu!', I had to turn around and come back. I was perfectly fine until then.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I'm back to the stage of feeling uneasy about the situation, I get so far and then out of nowhere came that 'Woomfph' quicker and stronger than ever before, but I got out that far with no worry at all.

*[Carl's system is now presenting this 'Woomfph' (and 'wave') on a regular occurrence, I deviate from Process #1 to elicit where Carl has experienced this before. This question is from my own developments in EK.]*

*And that 'Woomfph', when have you had that before?*

When driving.

*And before that?*

When I was a really young boy riding my bike, my dad had come to pick me up from a friend's house. And I wanted to go my own way which was probably twice the distance, and my dad got fed up and said "I'm going this way Carl and you're coming with me."

I was only 6 or 7 and I decided I was going the other way, my dad called my bluff and walked off. I thought he would come with me, he's my dad he has to. And as I was going my way, this car pulled up on the other side of the road.

It was that time at school when you had to watch stuff about 'stranger danger', I remember that this car pulls up on the other side of the road, I start panicking and then that 'Woomfph' as I am standing with my bike and then having no memory until I remember my dad is stood next to me saying "Come on! Let's just go this way."

Then I felt totally comfortable, with the calmness there. It was a red and blue bike, there's a laurel hedge. That feeling of fear, of utter panic and terror made me black out until my dad was there.

*And is there anything else?*

I probably made up a lot more of that than there actually was, when it probably wasn't true. It just happened to be when we'd watched a class video on the Friday and at the weekend I decided to go 'this way' instead of 'that way' and this car pulls up totally coincidently and because my dad had gone off and I was on my own I felt vulnerable and I had this 'Voom' (The 'Woomfph') of fear and panic - my throat's gone quite dry now (coughs, then yawns) - Oh I'm sorry I feel so very tired.

*And where could that 'tired' come from?*

That's from the adrenaline, why I feel so sleepy.

### Seventh Iteration

*And now what is happening?*

A dry mouth, I feel like I've just gone through something there.

I've occasionally thought about that memory from time to time, but when it came up there, I thought "Why? That's not relevant". But it is, it's massively relevant - it's as though I have that memory everyday, but I don't. I can't actually remember the last time I had that memory.

*What do you know now about this?*

This bridge and walking across it, it's not that; something about that triggers something.

[Carl starts to walk onto the bridge, has a reaction and walks back off]

What I am experiencing in relation to that bridge is not relative.

*And experiencing, and what has happened to the 'Voom'?*

It wasn't as intense, it softened the "Stop you're not going any further".

[Carl walks back onto the bridge]

*And now what is happening?*

I want to get lower because I am feeling exposed. Whoa, yes it is feeling exposed.

[Carl rapidly walks off the bridge]

It's lack of protection, feeling exposed and the situation is out of my control. I can see how all those three link back to this situation with me and my bike and my dad and the car pulling up.

And there is a difference now, when I'm a boy I am feeling exposed, I am there on my own, I don't have the protection of my dad, which when I am a young boy I certainly feel my dad offers me massive amounts of protection. And the situation feels like it is not in my control. Because I have lost some minutes of it.

[Carl begins stretching and rubbing his left leg]

*[As run previously with the 'Woomfph', I query the repeating symptom of Carl's left leg.]*

*And what does that leg (indicating towards Carl's left leg) know?*

It was there, it experienced it... I got on my bike... I got on my bike and pedalled like mad... I got on my bike and pedalled like mad... My dad **didn't** meet me in the same place, I got on my bike and pedalled like mad.

... What happened? ...

I was at my friend's house number 3, my dad came and picked me up, I was on my bike, dad went that way, I went this way and had to pedal like mad because my dad had called my bluff he wasn't following me - "Oh shit! I'm on my own here, I know which way I'm going" So I pedalled and I got to the end of the road and then the car pulled up, someone wound the window down and started talking to me.

It was a white car, a Ford Escort. Shortly after that my dad turned up, he'd gone another way which was quicker to come and meet me and teach me a lesson - which he certainly did - I was relieved to see my dad and then we went home. He spoke to the people in the car, they probably knew us and were saying "What are you doing out here on your own?"

So when I set off on my own, at that point where I felt the danger I'd already pedalled at that point and stopped to speak to the person in the car.

*And is there anything else?*

This is just little Carl's leg that has been pedalling, pedalling really fast.

[Carl is gripping and releasing his hands]

*And is there anything else about 'clammy hands'?*

From gripping the bike, from pedalling the bike and using the brakes to stop the bike and speak to the person in the car.

[Carl starts to walk on the bridge getting further than before, then stops and moves back]

I can start to feel it.

*And feel it, is that the same or different than before?*

It's softer, it doesn't come on as strong. [Carl goes back to the bridge]

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

Right now if I just concentrate on the floor put my head down and don't look around. I'm slow. I'm struggling to move my feet forwards. I'm starting to feel dizzy now.

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I just want to get off the bridge, I feel dizzy. [Carl walks back off the bridge]

The dizzy has gone, I've started to process things in my mind, I feel as though every time we are getting further, before something happens and the effect of it is slower to come on. It eventually reaches a similiar intensity.

It's almost like I can start to process it now, but it's taking up an awful lot of my resources to do that. [Carl walks back out on to the bridge, we get close to halfway across which is the furthest we have been so far]

*And as that happens, now what is happening?*

I'm looking up at that bedroom window and wondering if there is anyone in that house thinking "What the hell are they doing?"

Right, I feel as though I need to hold you. [Carl grabs my arm]

We are over halfway now and there is no turning back, I'm nearly there... I'm on the other side. [Carl breathes out a big breath]

*And as that is happening, now what happens?*

I did that, I came across there - my eyes were open, but I almost stopped seeing, I just kind of blurred everything so I couldn't actually see anything. Before I was holding onto the railing and I was looking around trying to rationalise everything, then I was looking just at the floor, I did look up to the right at the window. I wasn't massively focused on seeing anything, just "I'm going to get to the other side"

I held onto your upper arm, then we were past halfway and I started looking at the path again, and it became the path. Then I focused on this bit here, I thought it looked like the massive footprint of a bird, I thought "I'll head for that."

I didn't get the 'Voom', there was a slow build up but I could control it more, that culminated in grabbing your jacket. My leg is pretty still now, I can't remember if my leg did anything out there, my attention had moved onto what I was seeing, which is interesting because I usually feel, I'm very kinaesthetic.

*[This is an interesting comment as Carl's attention has now moved from a predominantly internal focus to an external focus. This shift in perspective may be enough for a resolution to occur.]*

*And what do you know now from this side?*

From this angle it looks scary, [Carl moves] and from here it doesn't look that scary. 

*And what kind of scary is that scary?*

The kind if something was going to go wrong it would. It's the angle, from here the railings don't look very high, you can see the perspective more.

Phwoar! I feel like I've done a lot of stuff here. [Carl rests against a wall] Jesus! My legs feel like I've done 100 squats or something, like a massive leg session in the gym. How weird is that?

*And is there anything else?*

That memory is the first time I can remember being scared. Outside the bubble of parents and being looked after, of being really, really scared - that's the first time. The first time I felt real fear and being scared, there's definitely something connected to that and it's where I've learned the response to it.

*Is that a good place to finish the session?*

Yes it is, we may as well go this way, we've done it once. Let us see what happens... [Carl walks over the bridge without grabbing me]

### Carl's Feedback

After a week I catch up with Carl to check in on how things are going: 

"It’s clear I’ve been processing a lot. The journey home after the session was fine. I was extremely tired so went the back roads by choice as I didn’t want to undo any of the good work of the session. I wondered if this was avoidance but the thought of driving home on the major roads and across bridges didn’t make me feel anxious as usual so I believe this was a sensible choice."

He continues, "Similarly since, I have no anxiety thinking of journeys that involve big roads or across bridges, but haven’t needed to do one yet. I think I’ll deliberately set out at the weekend to drive a route that involves a bridge as well as try some walking routes. Will report back!"

I ask Carl how this experience is different from before the session. He replies "It’s a big improvement as over the last 18 months, I’ve had symptoms of anxiety (similar to those in the session) when simply contemplating journeys!" I catch up a few weeks later and he updates me with, "I don’t get anxious anymore."

Many thanks to Carl for giving his permission in sharing this. Note that all names and references have been changed.
