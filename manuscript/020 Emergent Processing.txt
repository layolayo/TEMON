# Emergent Processing

{style=poem}
~~~~~~
New and growing senses developing within my being,
   alive in a way not fully sensed before,
      a fullness, a beingness,
         the eternal moment of now.

How did I get here?
What journey ensued?
I went in and came out of a toy train,
   a light bulb and the doorway to God.
To acceptance, complete, of all the above.

I was caught between worlds,
   always on one side, in fear of the other.
And yet split or torn.
Am I really on both sides together?

Not knowing and fearing the who or what was obscured.
Then just listening and seeing the outside as in.

Hearing at last, the messages unceasingly offered.

Discovering the joy in the truth.
The humour and laughter of finding myself

Becoming whole again.

The fear of oneself is all that there is,
   with that fear of becoming and knowing just who you are.

Now with the knowing of self,
   of the truth behind all that there is.
The truth that is mine, that created all this.

Now empowered to do what I will and I wish.
Unpicking the matrix, entwined through time,
   by our cultures, our ancestors, religions and all.

Unpicked and cleared, and seen as it is.
Illusions, distortions keeping the matrix intact

The joke of being just a self-made game,
   in which we all hide.
Then hoping and praying, 
   we can find our self again.
