# Process #4 - Example Session (Mark)

Here follows a client's session. I am very grateful to Mark for offering this material to share, as this session covers some very deep and personal material. All names and references have been changed.

This is an extensive transcript, it is included in its entirety to provide a real model for understanding some of the information and ideas that may evolve from what appears at first glance to be a very simple emergent process.

## Live Transcript of Process #4

### First Iteration (Recognition)

*And, where are you now?*

* Looking for a new life. I've grown sick of working the same jobs, and now want to do something that actually satisfies me, and isn't just something that earns money and keeps me in the rat-race.

*And, where have you been?*

* At my desk answering the phone, sending out quotes, following them up - selling someone else's products to make them money.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* Well, at the time I was happy enough doing it for what I was paid. But now it's very different. It doesn't satisfy me any more, even in the money.

*And, where might you be?*

* Doing something I really love doing. That does open up a few options though! Ermm.. having a thriving base of clients using my NLP skills. 

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* That is a new life, happy - where I was hoping or planning to be - the sick feeling has gone, I look back on the old job.

*And, where else have you been?*

* Just finishing college, I was free for a while - doing what I wanted, seemed like there wasn't any responsibility at that time, just a time to enjoy.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* Worlds apart. Now I'm stuck in a whole host of responsibility and it's the kind I'm not happy with - back then was so easy.

*And, where else might you be?*

* Still stuck in this job, doing the same thing - earning money, but the longer I'm in it, the more I want to get out. So I'll be on a spiral of depression.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* This is like my fear, somewhere I don't want to go - I've had a breakdown already, I don't want another one - at the moment I have a choice and that is good!

*And, where else have you been?*

* I had a choice when going to University, when leaving University and after college - it seems like the number of choices get smaller as I get older... is that what this is actually about? 

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* I'm at a point when I don't feel like I have many choices left. It's like if I stay I'm stuffed and if I leave then I'm stepping into the unknown and I don't know if I will survive.

*And, where else might you be?*

* I could be on the phone, talking to the ex-boss, pleading for my job back... but at least I'd tried something new or different.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* I'd be a step forward - at least I would know the result. In this situation it is a failed attempt, but the recovery is doable - I think. What else would happen if the ex-boss said no...?

### Second Iteration (Effect)

*And, where are you now?*

* What is my worth? Do this company actually value me? Do I value myself? What am I willing to do to provide for my wellbeing and that of my family?

*And, where have you been?*

* My lowest point was probably when everything went wrong with Melanie. I went off the rails a bit - strayed from the path and got myself into trouble - that led to another real low, to get out that place... Damn, it feels like I never really recovered, I still dread some of the thoughts from then.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* I have built myself up to now, I got through all of that - yes, parts still affect me, they probably always will - it's like that story of the ball in a box pressing a button - Now I want to take myself to the next stage, it's as though I've had enough suffering, it's time for something good to really happen.

*And, where might you be?*

* I could be living in a place like Spain or France, not too far from what is happening back home with the family, but somewhere where I am comfortable - not sure how I am supporting myself here, but I'm happy drinking red wine, eating cheese and fresh baked bread.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* 'Now' is very serious - 'Then' is that freedom I had - freedom from all the stresses from now - it's a pipedream. A lovely, long extended holiday - a retirement plan..? Why wait till you're nearly dead in the ground to enjoy all the things you've worked your life for..?  

*And, where else have you been?*

* At eight years old, sat in a library - fascinated with all the books and information around me.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* Very different - there doesn't seem to be a sense of value for me, the value then was on the vast stores of knowledge around me - now it is about having something else value me... I valued it (books etc.), now it (work, company, myself) has to value me... what the fuck?

*And, where else might you be?*

* I could be still in the first 'Now' place, wondering, hoping, deliberating over and over and never getting anywhere.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* That would be stepping back, feels like I've already moved on - I could be deliberating over values, wondering what is important? That's what I am wondering now, and to who is the importance aligned with? For me, for someone or something else?

*And, where else have you been?*

* Completing my NLP course, excited and euphoric about doing something amazing with it all.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* There is a sense of what I can do in the world now. I am offering value at another level than just selling stuff. Now I am doubting or questioning my value. Have I lost my way?

*And, where else might you be?*

* With a firm acknowledgment of value for self and what is being done - knowing that I am on the right path - like confirmation of doing my life's work. Walking a path that was designed? or laid out for me? but that goes against my sense of choice and will... maybe it is something else.. not defined... something else... 

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* The company doesn't exist in the future one - It is me and my focus, doing something with dedication and motivation - very different from the query and questioning of now.

{pagebreak}

### Third Iteration (System and Form)

*And, where are you now?*

* Looking at how all this could come about - thinking that I need a plan, a way to achieve what I really want - but that is what is needed first: a firm idea of what I want to be.

*And, where have you been?*

* At an old job, took what was available, I needed to earn some cash so took it - they were ok to work for, but eventually I began to see they were abusing my position by getting more and more from me but not paying for it. I left then.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* I realised that I was worth more than what they were paying - these people will do that and keep doing that unless you prove that you're worth more to them. Leaving is not the only option. I had an option then, another one came along... if that had not been there would I have continued on in despair? Did I create the opportunity? In that the new company recognised I was worth more, then yes!

*And, where might you be?*

* Having someone recognise I am worth more - so that I don't take responsibility for the change, they are the catalyst - there is something unsettling about that... I should be the one to create change.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* Having an option put in front of me, now is looking for one, not creating one, now I am considering that if I do not have that plan or idea, then all that will happen is I will require an option placed in front of me - in that way it is a basic choice: stay or go.

*And, where else have you been?*

* Empowering myself through further education, so that more opportunities were available to me.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* I had a plan of the kind of work I wanted to be doing, so I paid and trained in it - that was also true of the NLP work, I thought it was just for interest, but then it became something more valuable than that - the potential was greater - maybe I need to train more? 

*And, where else might you be?*

* On another course - maybe a trainers course or another method, maybe learning EK or Clean better?

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* Later there is an intention, something to move towards - but is it just short term? The ideas of now are longer term, maybe I am not pushing my timeline forward enough - I'm stuck here and cannot see there...

*And, where else have you been?*

* Getting the job at the desk, that appeared to fit all the criteria - security, big name, fresh start, safe. But boring, damn boring, and the policy and backstabbing to climb the ladder is appalling. This is not what I signed up for and if I keep my head down and just do this I'll end up brain-dead. But getting the job was a great feeling, full of aspiration... so what happened?

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* Some of the key factors, like aspiration with security and that safe feeling - that has gone. Now it's just monotonous - Am I looking for a 'bazinga', 'bang', 'woo-woo' kind of thing? or just something that I can mould into my own creation? I started here thinking that working for another was a no-no and that keeps coming back to mind.

*And, where else might you be?*

* I can assist with some training courses, I've got the connections - They would probably be unpaid, but I would get to help out, I would get additional training and some great experience with new learners - and maybe even get to apply that extra knowledge at my current role.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* This is a far more positive stance - there is a half-way house, it's not all out or all in - this has a good feeling attached.

{pagebreak}

### Fourth Iteration (Consequences and Contradiction)

*And, where are you now?*

* Now thinking of possibilities, some real, down to earth actions that can actually happen - there is also a shift in how I feel about work, as if I can do something about it now.

*And, where have you been?*

* Making the firm decision to leave my role at the time, handing over my letter of resignation.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* Back then I had confirmation in what I was about to do. There was a set future in place, I'd kind of made the necessary connections and had a viable plan. It worked out for a short time.

*And, where might you be?*

* There's a moment where I am leading some training sessions, I am clearly delivering content and also training clients on the models and techniques.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* There is more similarity here - feels like a reality, something that is achievable - feels like my unconscious is already putting plans in place. 

*And, where else have you been?*

* The alternative is here, when the plan never worked - I went back to a job that was shit and was expecting it to be different. I had to claim 'depression' and being overwhelmed, I had to get out - interestingly that started me on a clearer path, one that I was building. Not one put down by the organisation that I was working for. 

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* There's a sense that this new place I could go to, would be similar - it would be my land. Am I brave enough to do it, am I prepared?

*And, where else might you be?*

* Stuck, questioning, on the street - I lose my house and family, I am unable to support anyone, even myself - this is like the worst situation that could occur - I suppose I have to consider it...

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* It could happen, this is a reality for some people - when everything lines up and it all goes wrong, I don't feel I would go that destitute, I'm not an alcoholic, or drug addict, my dependencies are the kids - If it all went to shit, I would get a job picking potatoes if I had to.

*And, where else have you been?*

* What's the shittest thing I've had to do? ... The worst experience was the abuse - not by choice, but it was the worst thing that happened.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* There were no possibilities, the only thing I could do was lock it all up, put on a brave face and pretend to everyone that nothing was wrong - I was scared to let people know, as it would be my fault and my parents would want to know what I had done to make it happen... That was my thinking, it was a sad situation and still today, no one knows about it. Now there are possibilities, but they are tainted by this. That same idea of "it's all my fault, what have I done?"

*And, where else might you be?*

* I could be stuck continuing to express this inner fear, to be self-blaming and not doing things because of a deep rooted pain.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* Are these the same? There was a feeling of positivity, now it's anything but that. The bit that they are both possible realities, if this pain remains then will I always hold this fear and being scared to move - one of them is me now and the other is twelve - a twelve year old who is wracked with guilt and fear.

### Fifth Iteration (Unravel)

*And, where are you now?*

* I don't know any more - at one point I was happy about this and now I'm confused and upset, I wasn't expecting to have those memories come back. I'd locked them away. To see that they are still affecting me is sad and also frustrating. That young me was lost and no one could help, as they didn't know. I was so very introverted, I have always been so very introverted since then, in fact I think I probably still am - that's why I keep going round in circles with all this. I keep it all inside

*And, where have you been?*

* Coming home after the first time it happened, I was quiet and said everything was ok. Then went upstairs to the bathroom to clean myself, then there is nothing.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* That is a blank, I know that there is sadness and guilt, trying and willing it all to go away. I didn't know what to do then, too. I went into hiding, learning to put on a brave face, to not have any feeling, whilst enveloped in some inner turmoil. That turmoil is still there - that is where this comes from. From a scared, confused and upset child with no voice or ally to be with. I feel now like I'm all on my own with this, feel that no one else can understand what is happening, so I keep it all inside.  

*And, where might you be?*

* Sitting comfortable with all the above, after resolving all the issues - knowing that the pain and hurt from those yesterdays no longer have to cause me problems in today. Seeing the connections of those feelings and how I was being exposed, in what is happening now and has been happening to me, and knowing that they no longer need to do that, that those things have passed and I have grown older and it may take time but it is possible for the past to be cleared and for it to be eventually laid to rest.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* Acceptance versus confusion, a brighter future versus a stuck past, a new idea about me and what I can be - in a way who I am already becoming... strange!?!

*And, where else have you been?*

* I got an image of me as a baby, innocent and calm.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* The now is a little different, it's not the innocent and calm - that's like a vast open future - infinite possibilities but with no required intention. The now I have is not as confused, a bit more relaxed, a bit more accepting of who I have been and become. There is intention and direction now. It feels like I can reach out. Before, I was reaching in. 

*And, where else might you be?*

* There's a large room with banners and rows and rows of people, I'm there as a guest speaker, looking smart and professional - everyone looks interested and cheerful. There is acceptance within me and towards me. I haven't seen this or felt this before, there doesn't feel to be anything getting in the way.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* It is like now and my feelings are coming together, what I am experiencing is actually happening within me - even though this is a possible future, it is like I am creating it without effort.

*And, where else have you been?*

* It is the baby again, with a smile, like the baby is creating and just being there, enjoying life and the love bestowed upon it - pure joy.

*Compare where you have been to where you are now*

* I would like some of that joy, that positive easy feeling riding over me, with nothing to get in the way, nothing to stop how I feel or how I may express myself, my ideas and thoughts just happen - like sparks and my body is alive, my mind is lighting up.

*And, where else might you be?*

* I'm just here, right now - this is wonderful, it feels like I came full circle or something. Wow, I am right here.

*Compare where you might be to where you are now*

* This is now (laughs).

### Sixth Iteration (Emergence)

The sixth iteration was not required as the client was experiencing the expected end result of the process.

The finishing off questions followed.
  
### Finishing Off

*And, what do you know now?*

* That my history had held me back, that I was caught up in quite a tangled mess - there are lots of things to do, especially with work and stuff but that doesn't actually feel like it is or even was the problem. I'd like to enjoy this feeling some more.

The next two standard questions were dropped as the client was enjoying the moment, so I finished off with a simple:

*And, is there anything else you would like to share?*

* No, just thank you! Thank you.
