## Stages of Emergence and The Days of Week

Here is presented a very interesting insight from Pam Saunders in how the pattern of Six [+1] relates to what we in the Occident have all inherited through our culture and ancestors – the seven day week.

The clues to this ancient pattern are still encased within the original names and symbolism of the days of the week:

* Sunday – The day of the Sun
  * Represents the self, one’s personality and ego. It is our identity and our face to the world. The space of ‘A’.
* Monday – The day of the Moon
  * Represents the unconscious, feelings and emotions – this is the reflected self. The space of ‘B’.
* Tuesday – Tiw’s day, the day of Mars
  * The god of war and agriculture. Representing the space of ‘C’; where the war / growth between A and B takes place.
* Wednesday – Woden’s day, the day of Mercury
  * Woden/Odin held the power to bind or unbind a man's mind. This is the midpoint of the pattern and interestingly Odin is traditionally depicted with a raven on each shoulder and a wolf on either side of him, representing balance. Mercury is the “messenger of the Gods”, the hermaphroditic intermediary between the Sun (A) and the Moon (B).
* Thursday – Thor’s day, the day of Jupiter.
  * Thor, the God of thunder, whose hammer is able to throw lightning bolts. Jupiter astrologically represents the ability of the organism and the spirit to expand, and in Roman mythology also has the symbol of a lightning bolt and is the King of the Gods, bringing truth and intellect. The opening of 'C' and a bolt from 'D'
* Friday – Freya’s day, the day of Venus
  * The goddess of love, beauty, and fertility. Bringing into being, manifestation. The emergence of a new creation 'E'.
* Saturday – The day of Saturn
  * Signifying rest and contemplation. Saturn also represents our limitations, our restrictions, yet he is also our inner mentor and teacher. His lessons are manifested only over time, after which we go through inner rebirth and enjoy spiritual growth. The integration of 'E' -> 'A'.

This connection between the two patterns (the naming and order of the days with the seven stages of emergence) opens the door to many questions and for myself conjures up many interesting ideas about how this could be so.

In my mind there is no doubt that the pattern matches, my query is based on the historical record and to this I am unable to give an answer. So I simply offer this here now as a curiosity - dwell upon the significance in your own manner and time, I am very happy to hear and learn of your considerations in this matter.

Pam’s description is linked more closely to engineering process and to the essential nature of the fractal, such as cycle, projection, reflection, space, metaphor, sequence and manifesting. See "The Emperor's New Psychology" for a full exploration of this.

I have further researched this patterning for interest and discovered that this structure, the days of the weeks and their symbolism, reaches back as far as the Sumerians. From there this pattern then echoes out through the Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Germanic cultures.
