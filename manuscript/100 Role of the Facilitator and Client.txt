# Role of the Facilitator and Client

In this chapter we look at the basic premises required for the facilitator and the client in Emergent Knowledge processing, finishing off with a look at how David was making his work 'Cleaner' with each new iteration.

## The Facilitator

The facilitator does not make comment on, interpret for or lead the client. They only ask the questions or give the instructions as specified, then listen and acknowledge their response, until the client reaches the end of their process.

The facilitators acknowledgments are kept to a minimum, to avoid interruption. A simple, "Okay", "Yeah", "Uh-uh" will be sufficient to keep the session flowing.

EK processes are very simple and, once the client is familiar with the flow of the process, they may even begin to run it themselves. When this occurs, the client only requires active facilitator input when they halt or become lost in their space. This is usually recognised by the client bringing their attention back to the facilitator.

During the clients self-modelling moments, the facilitator simply becomes an observer of the system. This role could be known as the 'silent witness' position.

So, if your client is not looking at you, they are most likely still internally processing the last question or instruction you gave. Do not interrupt this.

In this silent witness position, one is to only observe and witness the client change. This is a highly privileged position, and the space you have been granted is to be given the utmost respect.

## The Client

What is true for the client is true for the client, even if what they are stating appears to be clearly untrue and without reason to you as a facilitator; **it is true** for the client and you're not there to invalidate the client's understanding of their life.

If the client requests you may inform them of what Emergent Knowledge facilitation is, and what the process consists of, although even this is not a requirement, as they will very soon pick this up once they begin.

## Can I Run These Processes on My Own?

Yes, this is possible, and it is intended that through practice you may achieve this.

Initially, though, it is recommended that you experience several facilitated sessions, especially if you have no direct experience of Clean Space or Emergent Knowledge.

It should also be noted that it is uncommon for a new *self-processing* client to fully connect with and directly experience the moments in which the process intends. The new self-processing client is generally operating from an intellectualised viewpoint when running EK processes alone.

This is mainly due to there being a split, where we have one aspect of the self presenting a part of the process to another listening aspect of the self, whilst that listening aspect is attempting to be fully immersed in the process at the same time!

Looking at the A to F Model, we are attempting to be at positions 'F' and 'A' in the same moment.

This can take a lot of time and practice to achieve, if at all for some people. Therefore, to begin with it's recommended that you find a companion to work with, and facilitate each other through these processes.

With the advent of EK, David was looking at how to remove the facilitator from the process altogether - we discussed how this could happen many times. My current operational interpretation of how people may easily experience this is available at the Powers of Six website using an online facilitator see 'The Iterators I & II' once registered and logged into the website.

Here follows a short story on where I believe David first recognised how this could be done.

### David's Prescriptions in New Zealand

Back when David was developing his ideas about Emergence and iteration, he ran an Emergent exercise in a New Zealand doctor's practice. As the clients were waiting for their appointment they were given the opportunity to see David.

David would greet them and explain what he wanted them to do, he would ask them what they knew about their problem and then he would write down on his pad a series of questions. This he considered to be the client's 'Emergent Prescription'.

They would leave the room and write down their answers to his questions. Once complete, they were requested to come back and 'Download' to David on their experience.

This was a first descent into the realm of 'removing the facilitator from the process'. It was a success, and gave David the impetus to continue his research into more detailed and cleaner ideas and processes, which would become the core structure to his work in Emergent Knowledge.

## Self-Modelling

The more one uses the processes presented here with a client, or on oneself, the easier and more fluid running them becomes. You and your client will become more proficient at recognising and interacting with the space around you. Especially when running the more advanced processes, such as Process #4 where you will find connecting to and experiencing prior and future moments, along with the ability to hold these in mind for comparison with your present state, becomes second nature.

This deeper understanding of our inner architecture and the relationship we have with it, is known as self-modelling. Once you become adept at this, the ability to self-process with EK develops rapidly.

On reading through the transcripts in this book you will see the moments where the client begins to self-model and takes control of their process.

## Cleaner than Clean

It has been stated by David, myself and others that EK is 'Cleaner than Clean', or can be likened to Clean Language Mark 2.0. The reasoning for this is to be understood through several aspects:

First, is what David was looking to do above - 'Remove the facilitator from the process'. This is because the facilitator in Clean Language and Clean Space is introducing their own perception into the client's system by selecting and working with the spaces and the metaphors. Clean Space was a step away from Clean Language in this regard, but David was aware that the facilitator was still attached to the system.

Secondly, the questions utilised did not reference the client's system directly. The use of, *"What do you know about that?"* keeps the facilitator from getting directly involved; the client takes the questions where they need to go.

Thirdly, the Iterative Pattern of Emergence and EK model in general moved towards running algorithms, which are processes built to set structures. As David was developing therapeutic methods, he would reference his work as being in service to an aspect of it: in Clean Language, we were *“in service to the metaphor”*; in Clean Space, *“in service to the space”*; and finally, with emergence, *“in service to the algorithm.”* As his aim was to 'remove the facilitator', the development of the algorithm was the key to this.
