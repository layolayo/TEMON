# Process #3 - Example Session (Jean)

Here is a clientâ€™s session of the Basic Four Flows process. This has been written up afterwards from a recorded session. As this is personal material, any names and references have been changed.

Clean Space work can be difficult to express only in words as so much information is gleaned from the client's interaction with their psychoactive space, where significant adjustments or realisations were made these have been annotated to the transcript.

Thank you to Jean for giving her permission to share this material.

## Live Transcript of Process #3

### First Iteration (Recognition)

![Jean's Starting Piece](images/rugpull.jpg)

*"Write up what you'd like to work on."*

* The Rug Pull 

When Jean came into the session she mentioned that she keeps getting rugs pulled out from beneath her.

*"And where are you now in relationship with 'The Rug Pull'?"*

* Just back from it, here; this space is called 'Cautious'.

*"What must you not get from that?"* ('Rug Pull')

* Unpleasantly Surprised.

*"What must you get from that?"*  

* Caution, I'm protecting myself.

*"What must you make sure that doesn't get from you?"* 

* Trust.

*"What must you make sure that does get from you?"* 

* Respectful Ambivalence.

*"And what do you know now about this?"*

* I constantly get side-swiped by it, I feel it's a semi-regular occurrence in my life. 
* This space is called: "It's out to get me!"

### Second Iteration (Effect)

We now use "It's out to get me!" as the focus.

*"And where are you now in relationship with 'It's out to get me!'?"*

* I'm back here, quite a distance away, I'm nowhere near those other bits.

*"What must you not get from that?"* 

* I mustn't allow it to get me, to lull me into a false sense of security, I'm a sucker!

Jean then provides an aside history relating to this false sense of security - It is written down, named "Lewis P." and placed. 

*"What must you get from that?"* (Ref: 'It's out to get me!')

* The Upper Hand as that is the ultimate aim AND not allowing previous rug-pulls to stop me making decisions.

Note that at this point Jean begins to self-model and moving and placing papers herself with no further instruction.

*"What must you make sure that doesn't get from you?"* 

* I suppose it's trust again... It's Implicit Naive Trust - 'cause trusting it is ok, but it's about being aware and not stupid.

*"What must you make sure that does get from you?"* 

* A realistic and understanding relationship with the rug, with an awareness.

*"And what do you know now about all of this?"*

* I don't have to be frightened of it, I have to teach myself a new way of approaching rugs.
* This space is called: "New Approach"

### Third Iteration (System and Form)

We now use "New Approach" as the focus.

*"And where are you now in relationship with 'New Approach'?"*

* (There were no words here, just a physical movement to a new space)

*"What must you not get from that?"* 

* Over-Enthusiasm because sometimes when I see a new approach I go rushing in. Also recklessness and impatience.

*"What must you get from that?"* 

* A steady direction - a framework for confidence - I see scaffolding in my head like a map... it's a guided map.

*"What must you make sure that doesn't get from you?"* 

* Rushing carelessly through it, it's about balance and not being too heavy on either side.

*"What must you make sure that does get from you?"* 

* Prudence - Looking before you leap! The action of considering the consequences before one acts, this sums up the balance.

*"And what do you know now about all of this?"*

* It's Achievable!
* This space is called: "It's Achievable!"

### Fourth Iteration (Consequences & Contradiction)

We now use "It's Achievable!" as the focus.

*"And where are you now in relationship with 'It's Achievable!'?"*

* At this point I've not started this process yet, so I'm back here... though maybe I'm a bit closer... I would say I'm here because that is me being sober about this and being aware, this is where the speed change begins.

*"What must you not get from that?"* 

* Temptation to rush, that's what prevents you from looking ahead and this leads to tripping on the rug's tassels. Which is why I'm face down on the rug and I cannot see the bastard picking up the other end, that's it! That's the thing, rushing to the rug, 
trip up, SPLAT! Thinking "Hello Rug, I'm here I've made it!" in the meantime Bastard in stealth mode has come up to the other side to flip me off it!

*"What must you get from that?"* 

* Confidence in the process.

*"What must you make sure that doesn't get from you?"* 

* Disrespect and impatience - jumping in without any thought, I have to learn there is a process to being in a healthy relationship.

*"What must you make sure that does get from you?"* 

* Respect and patience & diligence to trust and to follow the process and it's pace.

*"And what do you know now about all of this?"*

* Oooo, I have a tendency towards being impetuous... 
* Jean states "This is a bit of a revelation - Let's call it 'Epiphany'"

### Fifth Iteration (Unravel)

We now use "Epiphany" as the focus.

*"And where are you now in relationship with 'Epiphany'?"*

* I'm on the starting blocks, in preparation for the process - "Get Set!"

*"What must you not get from that?"* 

* A false start, hearing the gun before it goes off.

*"What must you get from that?"* 

* A sense of contentment and trust in strength of the starting blocks, the grounding of them. Even though they are temporary they are incredibly strong and grounded for as long as you need them to be.

*"What must you make sure that doesn't get from you?"* 

* That it's not forgotten.

*"What must you make sure that does get from you?"* 

* That it is remembered in the right place - take notice of it in the right place.

*"And what do you know now about all of this?"*

* To Slow Down, as I've yet to discover what this all is, and that's ok.
* This space is called: "To Slow Down"

### Sixth Iteration (Emergence)

We now use "To Slow Down" as the focus.

*"And where are you now in relationship with 'To Slow Down'?"*

* Here next to the Epiphany, because the Epiphany has the ability to eradicate the old thinking. It is an 'Old-Thinking Eraser'.

*"What must you not get from that?"* 

* Slowing down so much I stop.

*"What must you get from that?"* 

* A healthy pace.

*"What must you make sure that doesn't get from you?"* 

* (laughs) an argument - "You're not going to tell me what to do!"

*"What must you make sure that does get from you?"* 

* A willing cooperation - comes with understanding.

### Seventh Iteration (Rest and Consolidation)

Jean is asked to find a space outside all of this, she chooses one near the space "Lewis P." from the second round.

*"And what do you know from here?"*

* That I can see the WHOLE thing, I've moved to a place where I can get perspective, it's got everything.

*"And what else do you know from here?"*

* It takes up an awful lot of room, it's quite a spread out thing that takes up a lot of space. It consumes, the old thinking was destructive, whereas actually the new way of thinking might actually take more time it's not going to be a destructive cycle. 
It's like building the foundations right, so the building doesn't fall down.

*"And what else do you know from here?"*

* That the rug is actually a lot smaller than I thought it was and it's not as scary.

*"And what else do you know from here?"*

* Bits are symmetrical, which is not me as I generally don't see symmetry, but this has brought balance. Also, actually the bastard who pulls the rug is actually the same size as me!

*"And what else do you know from here?"*

* It's quite interesting as in the original drawing I made the rug puller quite solid, whereas I'm just a stick person, like easily blown over, but I don't think that's true. Seeing myself like that is the old way of thinking, I'm not that stick figure 
anymore.

*"And what else do you know from here?"*

* Don't go rushing towards the rug, because then I'll be able to see the bastard coming.

Jean is asked to move back to the position she started in.

*"And what do you know from here now?"*

* That being this close is ridiculous if you want to make a decision. All you're doing is responding to what is in front of your nose. I wouldn't call it cautious now, I think that it is more suffocation, panic and fear - I don't like being here I want to be back over here, this is my space to be [Jean chooses to move back next to 'Lewis P.'], I feel relaxed and I can see everything.
  
We end the session here with Jean looking at ways of integrating all this information into her day to day activities.

### Jean's Feedback

A week later I contact Jean for a catch up she starts off with the following:

"It was an interesting few days after seeing you, I was quite emotional, a little bit wobbly. Uncertain about just stuff, about anything really, about most decisions I was making. That only lasted a couple of days. I was very weepy however, for a good week, it didn't take much to set me off."

Jean then discussed a bit more about what had been happening, she is transitioning between jobs and had been deliberating about if had she made the right decision or not, also there was a great deal of emotional attachment to the people she was working with and was about to leave. All of this was initially expressed with a sense of the old negative emotion attached, it transpired however, that by the end of her story Jean was now talking and perceiving these changes in a different and positive manner, and the changes coming (contract changes) would have previously been seen as a 'rug pull' but not any more. Jean continues:

"I am generally on an upward trajectory emotionally, though I'm still easily provoked to tears. It's different from before, I feel less fortified because I felt my tension was this shield, if I look back on it. I wouldn't have described it like that at the time though. Now I can see that being tense like that has you in that 'fight or flight' readiness state."

"Now it's more like being behind a semi-porous, bendy and pliable membrane that can let things in and out, which before had been uncomfortable and I wouldn't feel or wouldn't let out. So there's things that are coming to me now that I'm feeling, that I wasn't allowing myself to feel from the outside before. There was almost a numbness before, which is beginning to give a little bit, which is quite nice because I feel like I'm beginning to be more like myself, because I wouldn't be numb normally."

"Being ok with not knowing is the point, the thing which pissed me off about the rug being pulled was because I'd put a solid expectation on something being the way that it was, and if it changed I perceived that as a 'rug-pull' and ended up facedown, whereas it doesn't have to be a rug-pull, maybe it's a rug-shift! and that's ok because you can get off, move it across and get back on it again."

"The membrane is flexible, it's breathable, it's not suffocating. My responses now are very different to how they would have been a few weeks ago, things are just rug shifts now. And that bastard is now sat in the corner sucking his thumb, out of a job!" Jean laughs.
