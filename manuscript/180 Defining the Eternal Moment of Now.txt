# Defining the Eternal Moment of Now

Here we are going to explore a new model to be added to the evolving Emergence canon. This model provides us with some tangible concepts and structures through which we may actually define, locate and experience the 'Eternal Moment of Now'. 

It should be noted here that this model is a diversion from the classical Grovian Clean structures, even though it is based upon the work that David was working on at the end of his life.

In this way it echoes his work in Emergence; though I recognise that it is presented as a defined structure through which to view human behaviour, it therefore may be better placed in another category of models, than 'Clean'.

The application of the model is performed through the Emergent methodologies presented.

## Four Fundamental Flows

### History

Back in 2007 when I was modelling David's processes, he was exploring with clients how they were responding to their perceptions and understandings of their issue and their psychoactive landscape. This exploration can be observed in the 'Influences (Force Majeure)' section of Self-Alignment, where the client who has previously been working on exploring their Project (something that they want to work towards and achieve) now begins to explore how they interrelate to it.

It should be noted here that David was moving away from a pure Clean facilitation with his process, as his approach was utilising some generalised spatial metaphors based upon goal orientation.

Here David was utilising the basic motion constructs of *move away* and *move towards*:

1. *"And what (internal / external) influences move you away from this project?"*

2. *"And what (internal / external) influences move you towards this project?"*

3. *"And what (internal / external) influences stop you moving away from this project?"*

4. *"And what (internal / external) influences stop you moving towards this project?"*

The internal influences were explored first, then the external.

With respect to the above set of questions, we can visually represent this utilising the A to F model. As usual the client is at A and what they are working on is at B (in this instance their Project).

![The Client and their Project](images/AB.png)

**Internal**

1. Something within A moves them away from B

2. Something within A moves them towards B

3. Something within A stops them moving away from B

4. Something within A stops them moving towards B

**External**

1. Something outside A moves them away from B

2. Something outside A moves them towards B

3. Something outside A stops them moving away from B

4. Something outside A stops them moving towards B

This dissection and exploration of influences has proven both useful and informative over the years, though through multiple usage of these questions I had always felt aspects were missing from the exploration, so over the last few years I've focused on the further development of this area.

{pagebreak}

### Searching for the Missing Pieces

This began by looking for what was missing by asking what the purpose of the influence was in each case, and noticing that, when the client had something to be wanted / gained, this generally resulted in a move towards motion, or, when something was unwanted / to be refused, this resulted in a move away motion.

On a basic analysis of the internal influences the following structures emerged:

1. A does not want something from B

2. A wants something from B

3. A does not want something from B but cannot stop it

4. A wants something from B but cannot get it

The same is true for the external influences, though these are not controlled by the client (A).

As the constructs of #1 and #2 are resident in all four questions I wanted to define the core structures of these first. Considering the way the client is operating in both of these scenarios, these constructs were named as Oppose (#1) and Expose (#2) respectively, a full definition of each follows.

{pagebreak}

**In Oppose**

I> Oppose: Set against, resist, obstruct
I>
I> from **OB-** meaning 'towards, against, in the way of' and **POSE** meaning 'to place'

* A is actively 'against' something coming towards them from B
  * B has something and A must not get it
  * To achieve this, A must **push** against something from B

![Some Ideas are Forcefully Opposed](images/comic_Oppose.png)

Examples from A:

*"I don't want to know."*

*"Stop treating me this way!"*

*"Please, can you just leave me alone."*

{pagebreak}

**In Expose**

I> Expose: Disclose, reveal, show
I>
I> from **EX-** meaning 'out of' and **POSE** meaning 'to place'

* A is actively 'for/pro' something coming toward them from B
  * B has something and A must get it
  * To achieve this, A must **pull** on something from B
  
![Exposing using Interrogation](images/comic_Expose.png)

Examples from A:

*"Was it good? Tell me, come on what happened?"*

*"What else is there?"*

*"You better tell us what you did."*

{pagebreak}

#### Expanding the Search

These ideas led to a greater understanding of the original questions (#3 and #4) which were designed to discover the internal and external conflicts a client was experiencing. Understanding the structure of these questions may get a little confusing; as in #3, where the client's Oppose (move away) motion is up against another internal Oppose (stop), and, in #4 the client's Expose (move towards) motion is working against another internal Oppose (stop).

Realising the potential confusion (as you will see later this is because both of these structures are of the same order), I stepped away from David's original questions and focused only on the basic motions and flows occurring to and from A and B themselves:

Over at position B we have the client's Project, which at the beginning of the Self-Alignment journey is described as something that is thrown forward (from Latin *pro-* meaning 'forth' and *jacere* meaning to 'throw'). However, once the Project is 'thrown out' there, from the client's perspective it (the project) is also projecting itself, i.e. it is flowing itself back to the client, for example this could be experienced as seeing the benefits and flaws in the project or the required steps needed to achieve it. Basically everything to do with the Project that the client is aware of and becoming aware of. 

Therefore, there are particular aspects of this Project that the client perceives as flowing towards them at A. Following this logic, there must be aspects of the client that also flow out or impose themselves upon the Project. This was the beginning of locating the missing pieces.

The search was nearly complete as I had now recognised that both A and B were able to Oppose and Expose, and it now followed that both could project or 'Impose'. Here were three clear ways of interacting. This was making perfect sense, especially when transposing A and B to being two people in a relationship.

This idea of projection has been given the title 'Impose'.

{pagebreak}

**In Impose**

I> Impose: Lay or inflict, force (oneself) upon the attention of
I>
I> from **IM-** meaning 'in, within, internal' and **POSE** meaning 'to place'

* A is actively 'for/pro' something going into B
  * A has something and B must get it
  * To achieve this, A must **push** something into B 

![An Idea Culturally Imposed](images/comic_Impose.png)

Examples from A:

*"Let me tell you about ..."*

*"I hope you're listening to me, this is very important..."*

On defining Impose the final piece was about to naturally and logically fall into place.

{pagebreak}

**A New Insight**

On having these three structural definitions, I then defined the logical opposite of Impose and all was revealed:

* A is actively 'against' something going into B
  * A has something and B must not get it
  * To achieve this, A must **pull** on something so B is unable to get it

Thus the fourth, 'uncannily' hidden piece was:

**Concealing / Hiding / Restraining**

I> Conceal: Keep secret, refrain from disclosing
I>
I> from **CON-** meaning 'with, together, jointly and completely' and **CEAL** (*celare*) meaning 'to hide'

![The Spy's Ultimate Concealment](images/comic_Conceal.png)

Examples from A:

*"There's nothing to tell really."*

*"I'm leaving"*

*"No comment"*

## Defining Two Mechanisms of Interaction

These four fundamental flows may be sorted into two sets of behaviour or mechanisms of interaction that either side (or node) of this basic 2-node system (A & B) could adopt:

* a destination side

* a source side

Both of these sides have the ability to produce a flowing-out and a flowing-in behaviour as previously described. A distinction is to be made here between A & B nodes and Source & Destination nodes as they are two distinct categories. An A node is capable of being both Source and Destination, likewise so can B. 

At this point we are only focusing on a single interaction of one node being the Source and one being the Destination. To help in this explanation we will consider that there is an item (a jewel) held by the source node. Utilising a physical object like this provides a good base for developing from. We will now drop the usage of A and B for the moment.

The fundamental flows in and out for each node are shown graphically overleaf.

{pagebreak}

### The Destination Flows

The destination *flows out* to the source, when **Opposing** the jewel from the source. This is akin to our original 'Move Away' construct, where more space between nodes is intended.

![Destination Opposes Jewel at Source](images/node-oppose.png)

The destination *flows in* from the source to itself when **Exposing** the jewel from the source. This is related to our original 'Move Towards' construct, where less space between nodes is intended.

![Destination Exposes Jewel from Source](images/node-expose.png)

{pagebreak}

### The Source Flows

The source *flows out* to the destination, when **Imposing** the jewel on the destination.

![Source Imposes Jewel on Destination](images/node-impose.png)

The source *flows in* to itself, when **Concealing** the jewel from the destination.

![Source Conceals Jewel from Destination](images/node-conceal.png)

{pagebreak}

### The Destination Set

The node associated with this set is referenced as the Destination or Receiver node in the system.

Be aware that although we have used the terms Oppose and Expose to provide an overarching description for the behavioural flows or expressions of this node, these simple terms do not and can not fully express the full range of available actions and reactions which are available or possible to the individual.

Instead, we must look upon this range as a long spectrum to better understand the available expressions. To do this we must first accept that the terms 'Oppose' and 'Expose' are diametrically (polar) opposite to each other, with the absolute expression of Oppose at one end and the absolute expression of Expose at the other with a full gradient of expressions in between.

This spectrum can be seen on the chart below as the horizontal axis, the Oppose side of the axis is Flowing-Out, this is represented with an arrow pointing away from the axis. The Expose side of the axis is Flowing-In represented with an arrow pointing towards the axis. At the central 0%, there is no flow, a point of stillness with no action or reaction, the 100% marks are the maximum flows possible. The angled areas behind are an abstract representation of all the possible expressions available to the Destination.

![The Destination Spectrum](images/chart_destination.png)

Below are some examples for each of the expressions. The numerical figures chosen are approximations of where they may sit on the spectrum, as everyone will have their own interpretation of where these exist.

**Oppose** is a determined flow outwards initiated by the destination node 

* The intention is to stop something (i.e. an idea) coming in from source (owner of that idea)
  * 25% : Disinterest in the idea
  * 50% : Dismissal, dejection, openly averse towards the idea
  * 75% : Hostility towards the owner in order to stop the idea
  * 100% : Anger, physical violence, even destruction of the owner to stop the idea (e.g. a war against terrorism)

{pagebreak}

**Expose** is a determined flow inwards initiated by the destination node

* The intention is to start something (i.e. information) coming out from source (owner of that information)
  * 25% : Interested to know the information
  * 50% : Requesting, negotiating to get the information
  * 75% : Demanding to have the information from the owner
  * 100% : Taking the information by force (e.g. interrogation)

{pagebreak}

### The Source Set

The node associated with this set is considered to be the Source or Provider node of the system. The expression of this node exists somewhere on the Impose-Conceal spectrum, shown as the angled areas on the chart below, which is designed the same as the Destination Spectrum shown previously.

![The Source Spectrum](images/chart_source.png)

Examples of these flows are given below, again the values given are approximate.

Impose is a determined flow outwards by the source node

* The intention is to get something (i.e. an idea) going into the destination
  * 25% : Presenting information
  * 50% : Talking over another and giving the idea irrespectively 
  * 75% : Coercing or intimidating another to accept the idea
  * 100% : Forcing another to accept the idea (e.g. threats, violence, torture)
  
Conceal is a determined flow inwards by the source node

* The intention is to stop something (i.e. a secret) going out to the destination
  * 25% : Not mentioning it, creating a distraction
  * 50% : Turning away, ignoring
  * 75% : Shutting down, secreting, withholding, suppressing, hiding
  * 100% : Destroying or vanishing self to stop the revelation (e.g. suicide)

We can see from the above four flows that expressions occurring at the extreme ends (100%) of the spectrums result in serious unwanted scenarios, unfortunately in life these do occur.

These actions are a last chance or final attempt at fulfilling one's intentions. We may consider that as one moves from the centre point where there is choice and opportunity, the further out we go the less choice and opportunity there appears to be. Thus, the potential final choice at the extreme.

## The Spectrums and Volition

A> *"Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."*
A> 
A> Stephen R. Covey

As one moves from a still point on the spectrum towards a particular expression, we can observe the direction and level of an individual's volition is directly related to the level of importance or necessity required.

What we are looking at then is a 'Scale of Volition' and this is finely graduated, the differences between each referenced zone on the scale may be subtle, however if one looks at either end of the scales there are significant differences of how we execute our behaviour.

### A Scale of Volition

To help in understanding this let us breakdown the full range of volition that is being presented into four separate levels or zones. Moving up and out from the zero point on our spectrum we enter the first zone: **Care-free or Natural**, where we perform and act with no hindrance, simply doing what is required to achieve our goal. This zone also comprises the elements of fun and playfulness.

Let us now imagine that some hindrance to achieving our goal has been located, at this moment we have entered the second zone: **Attentive and Focused**, where a little more effort is going to be required and we must start to apply ourselves and our attention to achieve our goal. There is still an element of fun in the engagement, though now we can expect to see purpose and planning involved.

As we persist in our quest here, we discover that what we actually want is further out of reach and in some ways is perhaps being withheld from us, we have entered the third zone: **Determination**. Now we must up our game and begin really making an effort to get to where we want to be, the actions we take here will become more intense and more determined. Now, we are becoming serious about the issue at hand, any playfulness left over from the prior zones is now going away or perhaps it has gone altogether.

If the affront to us achieving what we want continues there is the possibility that we enter the fourth zone: **Necessitate**, where force and 'called for' actions are administered. Here we are literally causing what we want to have happen with perhaps little or no regard to others and  the consequences following on. 'What has to be done has to be done' and 'The ends justify the means' are expressions of this zone. The requirements to get into the zone are both positive and negative, for instance 'The Civil Rights Movement'.

{pagebreak}

#### The Four Zones

1. Natural and Care-Free
2. Attentive and Focused
3. Determined
4. Necessitate

![Chart of Spectrums and Volition](images/chart_volition.png)

At any point whilst moving through these zones we are able to pause and make a choice as to whether we wish to persist or cease our interaction. This is the space that Stephen Covey is talking about in his quote above. Though it would seem that the further out we get the harder this is to achieve as our choices are becoming limited and our volition to achieve is increasing. Pausing and taking stock, taking the time to look for more options and other solutions really helps.

Here follows some example expressions of the Four Flows alongside this Scale of Volition. We will refer back to these in the next section.

## Bringing the Sets Together

Now that we have explored each of these flows (Oppose, Expose, Conceal and Impose) as independent elements, it is time to bring them together to see how they interrelate with each other.

To do this we shall allocate each source set to each destination set, creating four unique interplays:

* Impose & Expose
* Impose & Oppose
* Conceal & Expose
* Conceal & Oppose

On doing this we will see that the resulting interaction of the flows within each of the four interplays creates two distinct categories:

1. Complementary Interplays
2. Conflicting Interplays

I propose that these four interplays and the structure of these new categories are fundamental in understanding relationships; in fact, in understanding any interconnectedness of two or more entities.

Let us now explore these in more detail.

{pagebreak}

### Complementary Interplays

These are where the interplay of flows is 'Agreeable' to both sides and the result is 'Mutually Beneficial', we can see that in both cases an outflow is accompanied by an inflow, its matching counterpart, thus the flows between source and destination are open and unhindered.

In both cases, there is a positive response from both parties:

#### Impose & Expose

![(S) Impose *(out)* >> > >> *(in)* Expose  (D)](images/action_im-ex.png)

C> Source is giving the jewel to Destination
C>
C> Destination is wanting the jewel from Source 

* Source willingly gives and Destination willingly receives
  * like having birthday money given to you from your Gran
  * like a good conversation or consensual sex (flowing back and forth usually works best!)
  * like successfully learning or teaching something

#### Conceal & Oppose

![(S) Conceal *(in)* << < << *(out)* Oppose (D)](images/action_co-op.png)

C> Source is holding the jewel back from Destination
C>
C> Destination is averse to the jewel from Source

* Source doesn't give and Destination doesn't want to receive
  * like supporting someone on a diet
  * like living in denial of your partner's secret 'extra-curricular' activities
  * like a mutual breakup of a relationship

{pagebreak}

### Conflicting Interplays

This is where the interplay is a 'Struggle for Power' and the result is an eventual 'Overpowering' or submission from one or both parties. We can see that each flow is accompanied by its matching flow in both cases, therefore creating hindered and stifled flow patterns.

In both, there is a negative response from both parties; neither is getting what they intend.

#### Impose & Oppose (Collision)

![(S) Impose *(out)* >> | << *(out)* Oppose (D)](images/action_im-op.png)

C> Source is giving the jewel to Destination
C>
C> Destination is averse to the jewel from Source

* Source gives and Destination doesn't want to receive
  * like a game of 'hot-potato'
  * like physical abuse
  * like refusing help from a friend

#### Conceal & Expose (Divergence)

![(S) Conceal *(in)* << * >> *(in)* Expose  (D)](images/action_co-ex.png)

C> Source is holding the jewel back from Destination
C>
C> Destination is wanting the jewel from Source

* Source doesn't give and Destination wants to receive
  * like a game of hide-and-seek or cops and robbers
  * like cross-examining the accused in a court of law
  * like a child not sharing their toys 

It is within these conflicting scenarios that most defining moments are generally created. When one side completely overpowers the other to such a degree that they are forced to drop their position, and in doing so, they succumb to the dominating side, this can result in trauma.

{pagebreak}

### Examples of Overpowering and Submission

#### Overpowering in Conflicting Flows

* Impose: Forcing something on another they do not want
* Conceal: Withholding something from another they want
* Expose: Taking from another something they do not want to give
* Oppose: Refusing to accept something another wants to force on them

#### Submission in Conflicting Flows

* Imposed: Having something forced upon them by another they did not want
* Concealed: Having something withheld by another they want
* Exposed: Having something taken by another they did not want to give
* Opposed: Having something refused by another they wanted to force on them

{pagebreak}

### The Interplay of Expressions

To deepen our understanding of these interplays, let us remind ourselves of the Tables of Example Expressions from earlier ([go back](#expressions) and quickly check this) to explore a hypothetical scenario, starting off in a Complementary interplay and look at how that may shift and sway towards a Conflicting interplay and back again or, if unhandled may escalate out of control.

#### The School Classroom

To begin we have our teacher (The Source) inviting information (Imposing) to the interested (Exposing) student (The Destination), all is well and everyone is in the 'Natural Zone'. Whilst this is happening and working well then neither side needs to shift or is required to move into the 'Attentive Zone'.

Though let us say that now the student misses some understanding of what is being presented, they are no longer receiving information from the teacher - therefore their perception is that the Source is no longer providing (Conceal). This is now a low-level Conflicting interplay. To reinitiate and get this flow moving again the student moves into the 'Attentive Zone' and becomes more inquisitive and curious, most likely resulting in asking a pertinent question.

When the teacher responds appropriately and is attending to the student's needs, they increase their intention into the 'Attentive Zone' and resolve the misunderstanding. Thus bringing the system back to a Complementary interplay and once the student receives the required information. Both teacher and student can drop back to the 'Natural Zone' to continue.

Now, if the student had asked the question, but was still not getting the required understanding, here the teacher remains in Conceal and is now holding back the required information which the student really wants, to understand the subject. The teacher now appears to be failing them.

The student may now be motivated to move into the 'Determination Zone' and begin to interrupt the teacher making the required actions to ascertain the required information. If this is resolved, great! If not the student again moves, this time into the zone of 'Necessitate', as their teacher is proving unable to provide as required. It appears that the teacher is actually restricting the flow of required information. The student may now end up reporting the teacher to a higher authority in order to achieve their goal of learning.

On the flip side, let us follow the same process of shifting from the teacher's perspective.

From what was a good flowing lecture the teacher recognises that their students are losing interest and are becoming noisy (Oppose), they move into the 'Attentive Zone' and request the attention or change their approach to influence the students into engaging again.

The teacher and students are now in a Conflicting interplay, the students with no interest in the teacher or subject move into the 'Attentive Zone' of Oppose, they start to simply ignore the teacher and do their own thing. As the teacher's requests have fallen on 'deaf ears' the teacher follows suit and moves into the 'Determination Zone' to attempt to coerce the students back.

It is here that the teacher may lose the class entirely with the students becoming unruly as they push back due to moving into the 'Determination Zone' where they now begin to object to the teacher. The following 'Necessitate Zone' brings shouting, demands and people leaving by force or of their own volition, tables may be turned and things said or done that could be regretted later.

##### A Proposition

Let me propose that when a conflicting interplay of this level (Necessitate) has begun, if we are able to recognise where the other party is in relation to ourselves. We may purposefully adopt their complementary position to defuse a potential disasterous scenario. Then once we have both dropped back to the 'Natural Zone' and the tensions and heightened emotions have reduced, we may be able to discuss and start to make positive moves towards the original purpose. This next section looks at this in greater detail and provides a working model of how this mechanism works.

### Determinism - Self and Other

Each of the expressions we have looked at are representations of our self-determinism, whether we are the source point or the destination point. It should be recognised that when we hold a particular self-determined position in an interaction, we are also holding the complementary other-determined position out there for the opposite party to be or become.

In a conflicting scenario, this is a requirement to have our opponent change their self-determined position to our other-determined one, or for us to change our self-determined position to the other-determined idea of our opponent, this demand or at least requirement to change creates the conditions for conflict.

For example, a source point (A) is currently in the Impose position in conflict with a destination point (B) in the Oppose position. The other-determined expressions of these two points are:

* A working towards the complementary needs to have B adopt the Expose position
* B working towards it's complementary needs to have A adopt the Conceal position

Both of these changes are a 180 degree reversal of the individual's current position on the spectrum, hence why matters sometimes rapidly escalate into heavily charged situations and the eventual succumbing of one of the sides. 

A real world example of this is the development of the Cold War between the USA and USSR, where one side would make a move to establish their power and through this expected the other side to step back. For instance in 1949 the USA began imposing themselves in the Eastern Bloc, and implemented a propoganda radio station designed to peacefully bring a demise to the communist system there, to achieve this the Eastern Bloc and the USSR would have to move into an accepting Expose position, the counter-position of Oppose. 

The USSR remaining in opposition, pushed back against this and other alliances with an increase and threat of nuclear power intending that the USA pull out and stop their imposition, an expression of the Conceal position. However, the USA didn't and followed suit increasing their nuclear arsenal, this was a further increase of the USA's volition within the Impose position.

This to and froing continued for many, many years, creating more wars and an ever increasing threat to humanity. In 1990 we saw the eventual dissolution of the USSR and the Communist Party surrendering its monopoly of state power. The Cold War was over.

## The Three-Node Problem

You may recall from the beginning of this section that in the original influence questions (#3 and #4) from Self-Alignment, the structures of Oppose and Expose were presented together.

From the Four Flows model we can see that with a simple 2-node system this is a difficult scenario to build, for both A and B would have to be Destination Nodes. In this regard we have moved from a two-node problem to a three-node problem. 

We have the original two nodes A and B, and now a new node which we shall call 'G' (so that we do not give two references to C in the A to F Model). 

G has the potential to influence and 'Guide' the flows between A and B. The original two questions (#3 and #4) from the Force Majeure section in Self-Alignment can now be re-created using this new model as follows:

3\. *"And what external influences stop you moving away from this project?"*

This now becomes:

* What must you make sure you do not get from that?
* And, who or what is opposing that?

4\. *"And what external influences stop you moving towards this project?"*

This now becomes:

* What must you make sure you get from that?
* And, who or what is opposing that?

Other questions which look to discover G in the network are:

* And, what is in between you and that?
* And, what is around you / that?

Utilising the structure of a Three-Node system the original question set may be further expanded to explore all of A's four flows to and from B, along with G's four flows towards each one of these flows. And, if we so wished B's four flows could also be explored in the same manner. Although so far from experience, the application of this method applied to A is all that has been required for a resolution to the clients issue to emerge.

This process is advanced and quite indepth requiring training to deliver, thus it is only available on Emergent Knowledge training courses and through personal sessions with a trained facilitator. The basic structure of the Four Flows model is presented in Process #3.

### The Chart of Interactions

![Chart of Interactions](images/chart_full.png)

Above, we have the 'Chart of Interactions'. This chart provides a full representation of all the flows and interactions possible, in all the zones of volition.

The horizontal axis represents the Destination Spectrum, running from Expose on the left to Oppose on the right. Vertically, through the zero point, we run the vertical axis representing the Source Spectrum running from Impose at the top to Conceal at the bottom.

On each side of these axes are shown with arrows the direction of flow the relevant expression exhibits. Thus, the Oppose side flows outwards above and below the axis towards both sides of the source axis. We can see that the Oppose (out)flow below the axis is complementary as it connects with the source (in)flow of Concealing, and that above is conflicting as it connects with the source (out)flow of Impose. 

The chart provides a clear visual representation of how all these flows work and interact. 

Spend some time looking over this chart and developing a deep understanding of what it represents, then watch a movie or your favourite TV series, and notice where the characters are on the chart. Notice how their position determines the resulting reactions in the film. Are you able to recognise what the focus of their intention is on? What is it they are working to achieve? How far will they go to achieve it?

See the final section in this chapter on [Little Red Riding Hood](#lrrh) to read a breakdown of this classic children's story.

Expressions at the extremes of the axes are damaging, and become less so as they tend towards the centre, where there is little to no flow.

This brings us all full circle.

## The Eternal Moment of Now

Up until this point, the client has only been allocated to the Source position or the Destination position. Let us now recognise that as humans we are capable of being both in the same moment. We are *transceivers*, meaning we are transmitters and receivers of information. This happens constantly on many levels. Let us then apply this idea to the Chart of Interactions and this notion of Inner Peace.

When we allocate both axes of the chart to an individual, we can see that it is here in this centre point where the expression of Inner Peace sits.

For the individual who effortlessly resides at this point there is no requirement to prove or present themselves in any way (impose), they have no requirement to hide anything or turn away from anything (conceal). They're aware that they have no requirement to stop anything happening (oppose) and no requirement to have anything happen or come to them (expose). All of these expressions when made are made with known intention.

Thus, a state of no ego, no judgement, no resistance, no avoidance - just pure beingness. Here is also a reference to Wu Wei in Lao Tzu's Tao, for here is 'actionless action' or 'effortless action'; being in the flow of the Universe, where we are swimming with rather than against the currents.

### The Seven Attitudes of Mindfulness

The above centre point on the chart relates to and provides a model to understanding the classic 'Seven Attitudes of Mindfulness'.

* Non-Judgement
* Non-Striving
* Acceptance
* Beginner's Mind
* Letting Go
* Patience
* Trust

Let us now take each of these attitudes and reflect on their relationship to this new model.

#### Non-Judgement

Judgement is representative of the **Impose** flow. Here an idea generated within the individual flows out to make thoughts and considerations about something out there. Non-Judgement is when an Impose flow no longer occurs.

#### Non-Striving

Striving is representative of **Expose**, where the individual is focused on having something come to them or to happen. Non-Striving is the recognition of this aspect being clear and free of intention.

#### Acceptance

We can have acceptance of many things as well as ourselves and others. In Acceptance we are no longer **Opposing** what is within and outside of us.

#### Beginner's Mind

Coming at life from the stand point of the Beginner's Mind, shows us that we hold no preconceptions - we are free of our past. It is as though we are witnessing life for the first time. In this manner, we have some aspects of all four of the flows. We may, for the convenience of allocation, direct the idea of the Beginner's Mind to the absence of the **Conceal** flow, where one no longer hides from their past or has to 'stay out of the limelight'. One can comfortably just be, as though being for the first time.

Although accepting the above is ok, there is more than sufficient information here to propose an 8th Attitude which encompasses the **Conceal** flow specifically, perhaps 'Non-Constraint'.

#### Letting Go

The thought of simply Letting Go relates to achieving release on all the above four flows. Allowing oneself to converge on the centre point, from the sense of being the source and also being the receptor, letting go of all need and intention to flow in or out in either form.

#### Patience

The acceptance of knowing that moving from the upper zones on the spectrums to the centre point may take time, and it may require the energy and effort of overcoming and releasing the presenting issues that hinder this journey. Patience is a virtue, they say, for giving ourselves and others the time to bring about the changes in their lives to move from acting in Necessity, Requirement, Desire, then Naturally and finally to the zero centre point of peace. 

#### Trust

Encompassing all of this is the trust in self, and the nature of our expressions, that we are able to experience this Eternal Moment.

## Little Red Riding Hood {#lrrh}

To offer some examples of how the Four Flows model fits in with a vast variety of experiences, here is presented a short breakdown of the story of Little Red Riding Hood by Charles Perrault from The Tales of Mother Goose, annotated with the Four Flows model, be warned this is based on the original unsanitised version, there is no happy ending.

The story revolves around a girl called Little Red Riding Hood. Red walks through the woods to deliver food (custard and butter) to her sickly Grandmother.

* Here we have Red as the Source flowing out, on an Impose out-flow, with food towards her Grandma as the Destination who needs the food, which is an Expose in-flow. This is a Complementary interaction.

A bad wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket.

* The wolf is introduced as another Destination for the Source (Red and food), although with much greater intentions of eating. The wolf coming into the story also shows us the potential complexities of having a three-node system.

He secretly stalks her behind the trees and bushes and doesn't immediately eat her as there are others in the woods. 

* To hide himself and not be killed, the wolf Conceals (Source) himself. Anyone else in the woods is Opposed to wolves, so by not witnessing him we again have a Complementary interaction.

He slyly approaches Little Red Riding Hood and asks where she is going, Red naively tells him.

* The wolf first reveals himself and attempts to Expose information from Red, then after he Exposes the information from Red with his convincing manner and as she succumbs to his subtle deception, she then reveals, by Imposing, her true intentions to the wolf. Another Complementary interaction even if performed with bad intentions.

The wolf then suggests that he and Red race to her Grandmother's house to see who can get there first, which she agrees to.

* The wolf Imposes his deception upon her, his deceptive Impose fits perfectly with Red's previously Exposed information and her childish nature, so she follows along with it, her acceptance is an Expose in-flow resulting in another Complementary interaction.

He goes directly to the Grandma's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl and promptly swallows Grandma whole and waits for the girl, disguised as Grandma.

* The wolf again uses Concealing to deceive the Grandma and then fully (Volition 100%) Imposes himself upon her by attacking her. He finally becomes the Destination of Grandma by devouring her completely (a full 100% Expose). Concealing himself again afterwards, dressing up as Grandma to trick Red. This full Impose on Grandma is the first Conflicting interaction we see, though no Oppose is mentioned.

When Red arrives, she notices that her Grandma looks very strange. Little Red says "What great arms you have got!" ("All the better to hug you with", responds the wolf), "Goodness, what great legs you have got!" ("That is to run the better", responds the wolf), "And what great ears you have got!" ("All the better to hear you with", responds the wolf), and lastly, "What great teeth you have got!" ("All the better to eat you up!", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her all up too.

* When Red notices that Grandma looks strange, she begins to Expose the wolf, the wolf continuing to Conceal his true identity through all the questions is waiting for the right moment to attack and turn the tables, his deceitful Imposed answers are given to lull poor Red into a false sense of security by creating a Complementary interaction. Then, the wolf suddenly becomes the Source and Imposes himself upon Red by attacking her, and just like Grandma, the wolf becomes the final Destination for poor Red - the final Conflict.

C> **THE END**

As already stated, in this version of the story there is no direct Oppose out-flow mentioned. For us to include this flow we would have to assume there is an unmentioned Oppose flow in the devouring of the Grandma and Red.

It is interesting however, that in later versions of the story a Woodcutter was introduced whom fulfilled this role and killed the wolf and retrieved Red and her Grandma from inside it.
