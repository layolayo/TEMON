# Process #2 - Example Session (Sam)

Here follows a full session transcript from a client running through the Six Steps process - note that I made a few detours from the standard algorithm during this process as information being presented from Sam had been given enough significance to initiate this.

Sam also makes her own changes and emergent developments throughout the process, these are recognised and referenced as they occur. This is a common phenomenon as a client begins to access and work within their psychoactive landscape - as a facilitator we simply acknowledge the emergence and continue with the algorithm.

Also for the observant among you, you may notice that I only run the Over-Drive section using sets of five, not six as defined - this is an error on my behalf as I was utilising the 'Name this Space' step as the final 'Rest and Consolidation' stage - however, a successful result was still achieved.

Many thanks to Sam for giving her permission in sharing this. Note that all names and references have been changed.

## Live Transcript of Process #2

### First Iteration 

*What would you like to work on?*

My father's dementia, and mother's resistance to help - her fierce independance, depression, shutting down. Being contrary. [This is referenced as 'B' in this transcript]

*Ok, place that where it belongs.*

I don't want any of it at the moment, so I want it as far away as possible, but it is actually there. [Sam indicates directly in front of her face]

It is presenting itself, right here now.

*Ok, so place yourself where you are now in relationship to that*

I'm right here, in the middle.

[Sam stands in front of the paper on the flipchart and puts her face against it]

*And what do you know about that from here?*

That I'm stressed with it all, I'm overwhelmed and it's too much for me. It's all weighing on me. I feel regressed back to age 8/9.

*And what else do you know?*

I don't have to tolerate some of her attitude anymore. I can stand back from it and be my independent self; but I need to be, I want to be, there for her but more for my father. They're both suffering.

*And what else do you know?*

The way I'm dealing with it at the moment is like I have all of this stuff in a different box, it's all emotions - but I'm keeping a lid on all of it, because I have to for my father's sake. I'm keeping it all in [mental] boxes.

*[I make a slight detour from the process here, as while Sam is talking about the boxes she is gesturing to her left and right, up and down - this prompts me to have Sam locate this sensory information.]*

*And where are boxes?*

They're all over, these ones here are ok with lids on, but these ones have their lids open.

*And what else do you know?*

There's a distance thing as well, I live here and they live in Aberdeen. They're happy, but it's all starting to break down, it's reaching crisis point.

*And what else do you know?*

It's hugely emotional and it takes me back to when I was younger and I had to deal with my mother's absence. She would have to leave every 4/5 years and go to America which my father didn't know about, and then she would come back and they would get back together. I learnt to cope with it, my brother didn't and he hasn't seen them or me for over 10 years.

*[Another detour, I have Sam represent a younger her and younger brother these are placed in relationship to the information already there, more information now emerges.]*

I can see that everything is just like it was back then, I am the carer now and I was the carer back then - and all the emotion is all part of back then. It's like I'm going through it all again, but in a different situation. Mum has an 'Iron Will' that has always been there, it's all encompassing.

*And what could this space be called?*

Disempowering, regressed, angry, crushed mentally - it all sounds so negative, but it's not, she's fantastic company. There was a lot of happy times, laughter and a house of love. {Space #1 - Proclaim}

*[The image above shows all six spaces Sam visits on her journey, use this as a reference in this transcript.]*

### Second Iteration

*What do you know now about all of this?*

It's massive and a lot of high expressed emotion and it's just like a Pandora's box open and there is so much to deal with, but I can only do so much - Looking at it now, seeing how much is there. It's massive. I have to keep a lid on the box or it will overwhelm me.

*Find a new space.*

[Sam takes several steps back from her original statement]

I'm here, I've got more perspective on it now - having this distance is good, as I am relieved from it all. The real distance is good and this distance is good, I don't have to deal with it all at once. There's guilt here but not a lot.

*And what do you know from here about that?*

Maybe I could do more - I thought it was guilt, but it's not - it's a great sadness for my dad - I couldn't spend time with my dad because my mother is so controlling.

*And what else do you know?*

[Sam continues to step further back into the corner of the room]
 
Ultimately I am in charge of it all - but life happens, then hearing a song or seeing a greeting card and that can take me right back to there.

*And what else do you know?*

It's a very sad situation, but it was going to happen, their decline - I didn't really think about it. Professionally I know about this, but when it is your own parents it is different.

*And what else do you know?*

I need some support, as it is mentally draining and exhausting, especially the frustration that I want to help but she won't let me.

*And what else do you know?*

Here I'm more in charge.

*And what could this space be called?*

It's my self-preservation space, it has to be protected. {Space #2 - Explain}

### Third Iteration 

*What do you know now about all of this?*

I'm in charge - I have to stay here to deal with any of that {'B'}. This will always be my safe place, my constant. I've got to keep bringing myself back to here, especially when I get overwhelmed with the sadness over there {Space #1}. I need to accept help from others.

*Find a new space.*

[Sam moves to the adjacent corner of the room] {Space #3 - Reinforce and Expand}

*And what do you know from here?*

Physically and mentally this gives me another perspective. Here feels like me seeking support from others and making sure I do that. It's a reminder that I need to accept support from others. But also accept the limitations that I cannot deal with it all, some of it is going to happen regardless of what I say or do.

*And what else do you know?*

That it's ok to let go of the responsibility. Though when the 'Tide of Life' is happening, the vulnerability could easily knock me off center - so I need to be over there {Space #2} and over here {Space #3}.

[*The emergence of the 'Tide of Life', is a clear indication of psychoactivity within Sam's landscape - this is then followed up by her referencing prior spaces and linking them all up to one another, we are witnessing a natural Navigation interaction. As Sam progresses, the 'Tide of Life' and the resulting emerging landscape from this becomes significant.*]

*And what else do you know?*

[Sam moves to a new space in the centre of the room and states that this is where she is now - we continue from this space] {Space #4 -The Wobble}

It's like I'm in the ocean, wading through all of this - the tide is going to come in and I need to get to my safe space {Space #2}, if I don't get there then that's me drowning. Wading in, going very carefully, always navigating and that's exactly how I feel just now - with my Mum and Dad's situation, my own family situation, my work situation, I'm on 'hyper-vigilance' - but I always get back to the lighthouse back here. 

[*New aspects keep coming up for Sam such as the 'lighthouse', this is a result of the client's interaction with, and therefore the increasing awareness of, their landscape. It is also interesting to see how this emerging metaphor has a holistic scope to it, this is no longer just about a singular issue.*]  

*And what else do you know?*

I feel very strong, but I also feel very exhausted - because it's constant, it's tiring, I've got to make sure I get some rest and respite. The respite is these two islands {Spaces #2 and #3}."

*And what else do you know?*

I can see it all, the sand, the waves, very strongly I can see it.

*And what could this space be called?*

Drowning and Hyper-Vigilance {Space #4}

### Fourth Iteration 

*What do you know now about all of this?*

I'm either here {Space #2} or there {Space #3} and I'm very much in charge and the sand here is firm, it's solid and it has to stay that way. I've got to stay here and there, and there will be times when life becomes difficult and the sands will shift.

[with no prompting Sam now begins to draw out her landscape on a piece of paper]

If that's the situation and that's the waves, then here's the islands and that's the causeway - and I've just realised that this is actually a beach - I've just made that connection! This bit's good.

[Sam now places the picture in between her two islands and begins to walk between them, along the beach]

I can actually walk from here to here and I'm safe the tide can come in but it can't come further than the beach. I've got more beach and island than waves and that is good! It's very liberating, it just went 'click' and I've got more strength over this than I realised.

*[As a new space has just emerged, this is referenced]*

*And what could this space be called?*

Sam's Beach {Space #5 - Crash and Burn}

*And what do you know from here?*

I know that this is like in the middle of it all and I'm still wading through it but I also know there is a big wave that could keep hitting me and overwhelming me. And I can't stop the wave but what I can do is keep going to this place. And for more resilience and for support and for distance and perspective. I can also just walk on the beach and take my time until I'm ready to deal with that. Accept friends and support and look at it and just stay on the beach and on the solid sand until I'm ready to swim out again and deal with some more of it, but this has to stay solid. And that out there is the drowning point, the danger zone, that's like a rip tide. Hmmm, a 'Rest in Peace' tide.

*And what else do you know?*

It's good, I see it clearly that is I just can't go here {Space #4}. I can't go here unless I'm fully mentally prepared or even if I do go there I have to be aware that rather than let it all absorb me. I have to exercise vigilance. This is carrying me downstream, I need to go back and I need to draw on my own reserve and only go back when I feel ready to deal with it and that's only going to happen if I stay on that island, that island and on the beach where I can get a better perspective of it all, and just regain strength to go back into it. 

*And what else do you know?*

Well I know so much more now because of my age, because of life experience, far more knowledgeable now and able to stand on the beach and stay safe. Whereas at 8 and 9 I was in the middle of all this and drowning and encompassed by it, that was not a good place to be.

*And what else do you know?*

Well, now he *[Sam's Brother]* has made his beach and islands stronger, possibly before I did. I think he's been on his beach and islands for awhile. But at 5 and 6, he was the same as me. I was here and he was just holding my hand trusting me, and I had to get him to islands or a beach which were grandparents or dad at the time, so I was always helping him to get there but I do feel, because he hasn't been communicating with me for 10 years, I do feel that he stood back a long time ago with his family. He made his beach and his islands and decided to never go there, he's never gone there. Because he's never been to see them. He's just not going in the water, fullstop.

*And what else do you know?*

That it's all manageable as long as I stay on solid ground and keep accessing support and look after myself and only go there when I really need to but also when I am here be aware of the state of hyper-vigilance and exhaustion this causes me, that it's just not possible to maintain that state consistently. So give myself that break, allow myself to go here, here and here. Whereas. I was never allowed that when I was 8/9 it was all just cope or not cope with whatever happened, I was never allowed that choice. I had to go with what was going on, but now I'm allowed that and I can take control back.

### Fifth Iteration

*What do you know now about all of this?*

That I am in charge of all this and it's ok, I just have to keep doing what I'm doing. Because from here, on the islands and the beach I am in a far better place mentally and physically to lay all the boxes out, put the lids on them, and when I am ready to take a lid off one at a time and deal with that.

*Find a new space.*

[Sam starts walking around with her eyes fixed on the original statements]

I feel I have to keep seeing that.

[Sam finds a space a few steps out from Space #3] {Space #6 - Out of the Ashes}

*And what do you know from here?*

Leave all that and just concentrate on completely different things, fun and escapism, as that's vital to re-energize me; that's so vital and important for my self care. But that also re-generates me to then pull back to here {Space #6} and here {Space #5}.

*And what else do you know?*

This is as vital if not more so than the self care aspect because without it I become unwell, stressed and would be unable to deal with this situation or situations, so this is a part of me to keep in perspective by having other things, like happiness, sleep, enjoying the feeling of now being attached to this. To take my time.

*And what else do you know?*

That this brings the strength to go back in the boxes or, it's also ok to not open the boxes for a while. My box of self care has got to be full and strong and solid. And I need to indulge in that a bit and not feel that I have to go here until I'm really ready because the more perspective I get here, the stronger I will be there. But bearing in mind that it will be overwhelming.

I feel so distant from it *[the original issue]*, it's really good, from the first question I definitely feel the difference.

*And what else do you know?*

That it's ok, it has to be done and it will be done and it's okay to be done but not just for me, for my son and daughter to see that this is how it's better to cope, because you have to care for yourself first. To kind of perpetuate your strength. But it's okay to do this and don't feel guilty, don't feel guilty about that. Whereas I feel guilty is over there {Space #1} because it was always about my mother and what she needed whereas this is okay not to feel guilty - in self care.

*And what else do you know?*

That's about it to be honest like the self care is the paramount thing. I can't really think of anything else...

I mean, another tangent is the box that is my brother. There's a huge emotional minefield. I'm not going near that at the moment because it's resurged a lot of feelings for me about how I'm guilty by association, he hasn't talked to me in 10 years and he hasn't been near my mum and dad even though he lives a couple of streets away. 

It feels like it is my responsibility or incumbent upon me, I want to write to him saying 'Mum and Dad are unwell, you need to visit soon. I just feel you should know.' But, I'm not opening that box yet.

So I feel empowered here. A lot of empowerment comes from here.

The empowerment is there but guilt's a funny thing, you don't realise you're feeling guilty, but you kind of think: "Limit it or I will be back to that. I should be doing it, but no no, just you stay here a bit it's okay because you'll gain more strength from here than anywhere else."

And then you can go back to that in your own time and your own choice. And there's far less pressure here, but that pressure can sometimes... It's kind of like it's because it's always been within you because when you were younger there was that pressure, like an unspoken pressure. You don't realise, you just don't realise that it's there, but it takes you back to the situation where you need to be the one that's helping and doing and fixing. You need to be back fixing. I shouldn't feel guilt or feel more pressure.

Here is not to feel guilty or not to feel pressure.

*And what could this space be called?*

Well, it's the best space - a vital space to reinforce the fact that it's necessary, it's almost like I don't have to justify it. {Space #6}

### Sixth Iteration

*[I recognise that Sam has already created extra spaces for herself during the process, thus giving her six perspectives. As well as the emergence of her 'Empowered' space. So I began to close the session, first though I check in with a few of the nodes created during the process.]*

*What's in between The Best Space {Space #6} and The Beach {Space #5}?*

I'm standing a lot in the way of myself with that. But I need to make that time, that time is reflective time. I need to prioritise that. Also, if I start opening boxes before I'm ready to do that. Because that age-old, ingrained sense of pressure will always resurface, so I've got to not let that happen. So not to stand in my own way.

*What do you know from here about Hyper-Vigilance {Space #4}?*

I'm acutely aware of how exhausting, draining and disempowering that is, so to get away from that, swim back to here.

*Return to the First Space*

*And what do you know from here now?*

I don't feel nearly as overwhelmed with that, I was really in the middle of all of that. But I feel so much stronger now, I feel like I've got a bigger box to put it in and the lid is on tighter.

It was all so busy in my head, always there despite what you're doing - Now I feel so much more in control, I feel I've visibly made a stronger beach, this island, I've reinforced this island - the beach is solid here. This island is strong - but I still feel like I'm a coast guard always checking - but most importantly is being able to switch off from being the coastguard and being hyper-vigilant and take some time out - and it's ok, the tide isn't going to come in suddenly and sweep everything away, it's alright, it will still be there.

You need to shut down a bit, do self care and reflection time, meditation, and be in that space for yourself, your self-preservation, somebody else will be looking after the beach and the islands.

*And where would you like to be to finish off?*

I am here [Sam moves back to the Best Space {Space #6}] and I'm going to stay here for a while and feel joy and freedom and happiness - yeah I'm definitely here - this is what happens now.

I'm going to draw all this out. This picture will stay with me, that's a picture for life, it's great!

### Sam's Feedback

Three days later, Sam contacts me:

Hi Matthew, just to say a massive thank you for your time on Monday. I found the whole session extremely helpful and liberating! I literally feel much lighter mentally for what you drew out verbally and physically. Wonderfully cathartic and therapeutic, intense as it was at times! I also appreciate having the paperwork from the session to review when I feel is the right time. At the moment it's in its tightly sealed box as I am about to book a holiday for Steve and I on a firm sunny beach! Take Care
