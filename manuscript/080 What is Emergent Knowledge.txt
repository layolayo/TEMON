# What is Emergent Knowledge?

A> *"The emergence of knowledge via spatial and other transformations are thought experiments that take an issue or context and subject it to a series of observational perspectives, the purpose of which is to construct a metaphorical identity of the knowledge and its relational knowledge set, structural support and provenance."*

## Introduction

Emergent Knowledge describes a theory and set of processes originally devised by counselling psychologist David Grove, which was formed as part of his development in Clean Language and Clean Space. Though, it became its own body of work towards the end of David's life.

Further development and insights were evolved during 2005-6 when David began co-developing these ideas with Steven Saunders, who has continued to take this work forward and created her own set of tools and techniques based on the principles discovered in this earlier work, when I utilise this work or terminology it will be explicitly stated.

Here in Theory I the fundamentals of EK from the Grovian perspective are presented, along with my own interpretations and developments later in Theory II.

EK processes create the conditions in which new, generative information emerges from within a client's psychological and physiological system. They use multiple iterations of a set of simple questions (algorithms), each of which invites the client to attend to a specific area.

In response to the emergent relationships and connections between the answers, the client's system spontaneously begins to restructure its understanding of the presenting issue.

This restructuring generally provides the client with a more holistic and encompassing model of the world and their place within it.

### What Makes EK Different?

I've spoken with many friends and colleagues over the years about the work I and others do in the field of Clean and Emergent Knowledge. There has been a proportion of those people who held a view of therapy as something that was 'done to them' by someone who 'understood' their issues and could 'make sense of it' for them or even considered that the therapist was there to 'fix' them.

This had resulted for some of those I have spoken with, who were suffering with anxieties, to turn away from therapeutic intervention, as they believed that their experiences which had caused the suffering could not be understood by a therapist, and therefore could never be resolved by someone who had not gone through the same experience.

This idea of another needing the experience and knowledge is common, and continues to exist in many fields - for example, it may be observed in some areas of our social support services.

Please note that this statement absolutely does not seek to undermine any recognition from the highly motivated and determined individuals who have become clean from drugs or alcohol, got themselves off living on the streets, or dealt with their sexual abuse, and now work with similar vulnerable people to assist in guiding them out of their own current situation; it is simply a statement that recognises that change comes from within the individual, not from the outside.

Many a client has walked into the therapist's (also counsellor, coach or physician's) domain and walked out again feeling coerced, evaluated and even re-stimulated. This was a problem that David was keen to address with his work in Clean Language, to create a manner of working that would truly honour the client's system as it was in the moment that presented itself as the client began their session.

As his work was developing towards EK, there was a sense that even when using the original Clean methods an intention was still present that wasn't necessarily present within the client. Even asking the client, *"What would you like to have happen?"* infers that the client is wanting something.

Now it would be asinine to state that the EK facilitator is never influencing or has an intention, David was simply looking to create the conditions in which to minimise this as much as possible. Therefore we still ask the client the above question, or even some of the interesting alternatives which David proposed.

You will also see later in this volume, that I offer some very simple processes to be followed, though as one becomes adept in Emergent Knowledge processing these become more like a framework and a guide, for instance when I am working with a client in the transcripts I step outside the defined structure depending on the information being presented by the client. Note that in these moments I am always working within the client's developing model, not bringing in my own interpretations.

With the development and use of David's EK methods, those problems were reducing; his techniques allowed for the client's own inner expression to become that which created their own process. 

It is as though the EK methodology sits meta (at a higher conceptual level) to the client's process itself and therefore stimulates the client into their own unique process, one built by them for them. In this way any changes made are by and through the client. 

I see the use of EK methodology as potentially being a system of operating that could enable over 7 billion processes!

## The Seven Elements of EK

There are several significant elements of EK which, when presented together, offer a unique approach:

1. Clean Facilitation: The facilitator utilises minimal intervention and non-invasive questions
2. Iteration: Asking a question or directing the client repeatedly, usually in sets of seven [1+six]
3. Reinterpretation: The action of interpreting something in a new or different manner
4. Representation: Representing the answer in an alternative form - as in Clean Space in which we translate the responses into a physical form, then place those representations in space
5. Navigation: Relating each representation (space) to the others
6. Algorithms: A defined set of questions and instructions to enable a client to inspect and explore their condition
7. Present Time: The questions are given in the present tense

## The Emergent A to F Model

Before we look at each of the seven elements, let us take a look at the core model which is used throughout Emergent Knowledge. This model provides a workable map and baseline to understanding all the concepts presented.

### Starting with A, then B

![A and B](images/AB.png)

Generally, all training in EK begins with the above image and then proceeds to develop the deeper ideas out of this basic structure.

The client is shown in the above image to be at position A. Their stated issue or presenting condition is shown at position B.

Even though later we will be using 'real' space to isolate the issue (B), the separation of B from A here is purely conceptual to aid in the comprehension of the model and processes.

### C for Current Context

![The Client's ABC World](images/ABC.png)

There are two aspects to C:

1. The Space of C - the boundary encompassing both A and B creates an area known as the space of C. This is representative of the client's current world-view, i.e. what they are currently aware of with respect to themselves (A) and their issue (B). 
2. The Boundary of C - representative of all the rules and constructs that the client (A) has adopted to maintain this world-view.

The Space of C is also known as the 'Problem Space'. It is the client's current paradigm. Later we will see how our paradigms can change depending on our experience.

{pagebreak}

### D for multi-Dimensional

![The Space of D](images/ABCWorld.png)

The area outside of C has been called 'The Space of D' and also the 'Potential Space'.

Diagrammatically, we can see that D is everything that is outside of C; therefore, it is everything that the client is currently **unaware** of with respect to their ABC system. In this manner it is proposed that in the current moment, the constraints of C are holding back the information held within D.

This information could be completely unconscious, as well as just out of awareness. For instance, a client is upset about how their father treated them and suddenly left when they were young, in the beginning of the session all the focus is on the negative aspects of this relationship (Space of C material) this is all laid out and acknowledged utilising the Emergent Knowledge methods, then during the session the client's memories of their father at birthdays and coming to a school play are recalled (Space of D material). Note that these memories have always been there, they have for whatever reason not been recognised as being in the same world-view or category of 'bad father' before. 

Note that calling D a 'Space' can be a little limiting to fully understanding what is held in D. It was originally seen as being a resourceful space for the client, where it has the potential to hold everything the client is required to know with respect to resolving their issue at B. This comes from David's work in Clean Space, and it is here that we encounter a mixing of metaphors. 

Due to this mix, there is a requirement for a clear distinction between the logical structures of Emergent Knowledge and the working metaphors of Clean Space.

Pam Saunders proposed the idea that D is in fact the Time element. I have extrapolated this to offer D to be of a multi-'D'imensional nature, where it provides the potential to view multiple times (actual and alternative pasts, presents and futures), multiple spaces, multiple viewpoints and even multiple universes with respect to the client's original issue. Conceptually we allocate these as coming from D, as they were not originally present in C when we began - once recognised they become resident within C. 

Anything is possible in D; clients may access information from other dimensions (alternative universes or planes of existence). From David's Wounded Child work, the child 'frozen in time' is in another dimension to the one the client is currently in, and hence the messages being received from there do not immediately translate or make sense. However, once a client recovers this aspect of self, these messages and their effects are fully understood, usually with great relief and wonder.

There is no limit to what the client can access in D - in this way it reflects both Pam's 'Time' and David's 'Resourceful' space, as well as opening up further possibilities.

{pagebreak}

### E for Emergence

We also have E, which is the emergence of new information and understanding, which develops in the spaces of A, B and C. The starting conditions for E to occur are when there are sufficient new links and relationships forming within C, sometimes additional information from D is required to enter into the space of C.

![Emergence Manifesting through A, B and C](images/ABCModel.png)

It is here when all this new information comes into a new **relationship** with the existing information, that the boundary conditions of C begin to deconstruct or untie, as they are no longer valid.

As stated, the required information may already be present in C, it just hasn't been fully integrated yet, or the as yet unrecognised information from D must become known and understood in the current context. 

This is a complicated scenario with many facets to it. The core structure though, is that through this complexity and the interplay of all the presenting factors a new higher-level organisation spontaneously occurs, generally bringing relief.

We can also think about this as at the moment that A becomes aware of something in D, that part (+d) is synthesised into the existing structure, a new boundary for C is evolved to encompass this new information.

![The Space of 'C' Expands](images/ABCModel_D.png)

Emergence then, enables the new space of C to stabilise. It consists of a new set of constructs, predicates and understandings. The new space of C and its corresponding boundary represent the revised operational paradigm for the client. 

In summary, prior to E emerging the boundary conditions of C are deconstructed - i.e. the old way of thinking dissolves - and E manifests when this boundary is rebuilt, expanding out the space of C a little more into the potential area of D.

{pagebreak}

### F for Facilitator

Finally we encounter F, the facilitator, who remains outside of everything. This is why F is shown outside of D. Anytime that the facilitator brings themselves into the client's world, they are entering into the client's A to E world; when the facilitator begins to offer suggestions and their interpretations, they are disrupting the client's system, and potentially bringing aspects of D into C that have no residence there from the client's perspective. 

![The Full A to F Model](images/ABCModel-Full.png)

‘Facilitate’ has the definition: **make (an action or process) easy or easier**. It comes from the Latin *facilis* meaning ‘easy, easily accomplished’.

A key criterion for the Clean facilitator is to assist the natural evolution of the client’s system without directing or distorting it. David often said that this required the skill of a good midwife - *mid* originally meant ‘with’ and *wife* ‘woman’, thus ‘person with woman’. A good midwife works with the mother, taking their cue from the baby’s need to be born and the mother’s need to give birth to the baby.

This requires facilitators to be unusually receptive: sensitive to small, sometimes subliminal indications. People need much less overt intervention than many of us realise. Generally they know for themselves, at least when asked the right questions, what is good for them.

David said that the use of Clean Language (and now Emergence) "...creates a protective temporal and spatial womb or matrix in which *the facilitator's* job is to be a good midwife, and to recognise and develop and assist in the birthing of new information which is born out of..." the clients language, behaviour and ongoing experience.

## Defining Moments

Following on from Emergence and our A to F model is the question of how come we (at A) found ourselves stuck with a problem (at B), in the space of C to begin with?

Putting it simply, this is due to living life and naturally, or unnaturally, experiencing defining moments throughout.

These are named Defining Moments, as it is these *moments* when our life is interrupted to such a degree that we must shift who we are, and the changes we make in this shift *define* who we become. 

A defining moment is made up of two distinct parts:

|An Interruption|A moment where what one intended or expected to occur, was hindered or interrupted in some manner.|
|||
|A Shift|When the *interruption* was intolerable to such a degree that one had to shift and become different in some way so as to make the moment tolerable.|

This definition infers that any interruption or hindered moment which someone experiences is a potential defining moment, and it is, however this is wholly dependent on the individual's resilience or ability to handle that moment.

And our ability to be resilient then, is based on how rich and varied our life choices and opportunities have been to support and develop our internal systems to adapt and change to the ever changing environment. Charles Darwin stated, *“It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one more responsive to change.”*

Pam in her book, The Emperor's New Psychology, offers us the following:

*"...these aspects are created by defining moments within the personal life, where the structure of the personal collective changes, due to the personal measurement made of the defining moment."* 

And, *"In a defining moment a shock interrupts the smooth flow of awareness, and the person has to re-project awareness due to the interruption. The old sensing awareness remains frozen exactly where it was in space and time."*

Here follows an example of a defining moment shift in poetry form (or perhaps even the lyrics to a song...)

### Falling to Pieces

{style=poem}
~~~~~~
I'm falling to pieces
Something ripped right out of me
I'm being torn to pieces
Only half the man I used to be

You're taking over my will
I'm cowering here and waiting
As you deliver your strike
My heart breaks away
My heart breaks away

That moment, that splitting moment
The cold hard shock, not once, but twice
Cold, dark, emptiness, ringing throughout my being
My thinning blood runs cold as ice

Who am I?
What have I become?
I loved and enjoyed this life
I've gone, I am no more.

With nothing left to fight with
I fell and I succumbed
To your force and your denials
    of the world I knew before

I've fallen into pieces
Something ripped apart from me
These fragments drop away
Now only half the man I used to be

The other half's not me
Who have I become?
Inside now filled with anger
Where is all this fear from?

Is the tormented now the tormentor?
How does this pain find a way
    to release the oppressed and the oppressor?
Has this pain only got one way?

I've fallen into pieces
My true beingness ripped right out of me
Torn into tiny pieces
Only half the man I used to be
~~~~~~

### An Example of Resilience

Consider two children, both of which are playing on a swing in a play park. The swing breaks and both children fall and hit the ground. One of the children looks up and starts to laugh, thinking, "Wow, that was exciting!", the other child becomes distraught and begins to cry, thinking, "There's no one here to help me, I'm hurt and all alone! I'm never going on the swings again."

![](images/swing.png)

They both had a very similar experience, however their responses are very different and have a direct effect upon their well-being. Depending on the situation for our second child, different kinds of shift may occur.

In the future when both children enter a playground, our first child simply runs with excitement to the swing, whereas our second child tightly holds onto mother and may now have reservations about joining in the fun.

### The Shift

A> *“Trauma is an impingement from the environment and from the individual’s reaction to the environment that occurs prior to the individual’s development of the mechanisms that make the unpredictable predictable.”*
A> 
A> Donald W. Winnicott

Each time we make a shift and change ourselves due to defining moments we are recreating the boundaries of C, and each time this occurs these new boundaries are created within the existing boundaries, thus causing the size of the Space of C to perpetually reduce. This is a full inversion of the process described for Emergence, where the boundary expands out to create more space for C, a model for increasing awareness.

We are therefore consistently reducing our abilities and level of current awareness each time we are required to shift due to these defining moments. For it is through this process that we become increasingly less and less aware of our sense of 'who we really are' and increase the distortions of that which we perceive.

These changes affect our sense of self: a shift from who we were before to who we are afterwards. There is then a prior identity and a post identity. It is these identities that we connect with and explore, with the intention of retrieving the earlier ones and bringing them up to present time to be reintegrated into the present self.

Each identity is an amalgamation of purposes and characteristics which were formed to handle the defining moment at the time, this identity is then adopted and unknowingly retained. Each identity is created and perpetuated by the individual, not by anything or anyone else, therefore it is only the person themselves that may resolve each and every trauma.

This piece may look to be painting Defining Moments in a bleak and cold light, deep trauma may have all the effects described, though as you will see in the next section these moments also open up the opportunity to grow and become stronger.

In life, no matter what happens, or how well protected we are, Defining Moments will occur. There is also another set of **Positive Defining Moments** that may occur in life where through them life becomes more *tolerable* and they enhance and strengthen our sense of self, such as finding our 'Soulmate' or achieving a lifelong goal.

### The A to F Model and The Defining Moment

Just as we have utilised the A to F model to aid in our understanding of how Emergence occurs, we can apply the same model to the defining moment.

* A - Person

* B - Purpose / Intention / Expectation

* Space of C - What is known in the 'here and now'

* Boundary of C - Rules and structures required to maintain A's world-view

* D - That which is outside of A's current awareness with respect to A & B

![A to F Model for a Defining Moment](images/ABCModelforDM.png)

In a defining moment there is a 'projection' from D into the Space of C, which is of sufficient magnitude to interrupt B.

A now has two potential routes to manage this:

1. The interruption is categorised and understood as part of the existing world-view, in this regard A adapts the boundary conditions of C to accommodate. The Space of C grows a little and A's awareness increases proportionately. In essence, a natural occurrence of emergence in action.

	![Natural Emergence](images/natural_emergence.png)

2. The interruption cannot be understood as part of the existing world-view; here the boundary conditions of C have to be broken. Through doing this, A's world-view is no longer valid and now has to be rebuilt to accommodate this change. Notice that this is a failure of A's existing belief structures and view of the world. Here is the source of 'not feeling good enough', 'not fitting in', fear, lack of self-belief etc..

	![Awareness Reducing](images/awareness_reducing.png)

The restructuring that occurs in the second route adds more rules and beliefs than existed before. It therefore becomes even more limiting to the individual than their previous structure.

Sometimes reaching a crisis point, where more rules and structures are put in place are a requirement to make the steps out of that crisis manageable. And once the crisis is over, one may then be able to grow, adapt and step outside of requiring these rules and structures anymore.

## Evolutions of Thought

In an Emergent Knowledge session the occurrence of emergence appears in various ways. Here are some examples of how a client may suddenly come to realise something new about what they are working on:

* When a collection of seemingly unconnected memories brings a new perspective on all the memories and ideas and the client is able to see how they all interconnect.
* When the client's viewpoint or perspective of a particular memory or category of ideas is flipped or re-interpreted to mean something else.
* When a forgotten memory comes back into awareness which defines and explains the existence of the existing condition.
 
Moments of emergence are not always of a revelatory nature, sometimes we just get a glimmer of new information, something peeks through and we're only just able to capture it. For instance, this could be a strange sensation not noticed before, an odd image or sound in the mind, a repeated statement or word, a gasp or a short intake of breath. All of these are potential targets for the client or facilitator to attend to. 

Although this appears to be a small step, it is actually a giant leap; as this new piece of information becomes a part of the client's developing network it will be further explored and will begin to fully reveal itself through further iterations. David proposed that the client's symptoms were unsuccessful attempts by the mind and body to heal itself, thus the therapist's job is to create a suitable context in which they can encourage these symptoms to be successful.

The existence of this new information, especially when inverse, alongside the original knowledge of the system can put the system out of balance. The architecture of the whole system now needs to adapt to accommodate it.
