## Mindfulness

The idea of an 'Eternal Moment of Now' has links to several fields. Perhaps the most notable link at the current time is to 'Mindfulness', which has recently become a household term, and, with the many books and courses available, there are an ever-increasing number of ideas and definitions. Though it should be mentioned that this idea of mindfulness is significantly older than our recent connection to it.

Fundamentally, it is that state of consciousness where we are fully attending to our experience in the present moment in time.

There may be many times during a day when our attention becomes absorbed in obsessive or upsetting thoughts about our past, or where we find ourselves anxious about the future. When our attention drifts away from what we are attending to in this moment we can lose our connection to who and where we are. These are the moments where we can really benefit from accessing the 'Eternal Moment of Now'.

Our response and understanding of the world is coloured by our personal interpretation of the experience. This interpretation is shaped by our history, present time analysis and unconscious responses. For instance, a previous traumatic incident can have life long repercussions and influence how we see the world afterwards. Some phobias, for example, arise in this way.

As we accumulate memories and the associated interpretations, we may no longer be encountering the world in the present moment. Rather, at times, we encounter a situation through a set of considerations, beliefs and an identity created through our past experience. 

For example, suppose you’ve just started your first full-time job. On the third day, the boss sends for you and when you enter his office, he yells angrily that you’ve done something wrong, and he’s so angry and incoherent that you’re not even sure what’s happening. That would probably stick in most people’s memory. Then suppose, ten years and two jobs later, the boss sends for you. Your immediate reaction may be a spike in blood pressure, stomach churning, heart racing, sweating — because you are interpreting the present moment through that set of constructs, which were built on that past visit to a different boss’s office. 

Instead of being fully present, a portion of your attention is still stuck back in that previous experience. And, the reality is, your new boss just wants to compliment you on a well-done project.

Training our attention to come back to the here and now is a worthwhile pursuit which has been proven through research and experience to be a valuable tool for living and working in the 21st century.

## Benefits of Being in the Present Moment

Regularly accessing this state of mindfulness has been shown to offer:

* Positive benefits for our health and happiness
* Reduction of stress
* Enhanced performance
* Better focus and clarity
* A deeper insight and awareness of self
* Improved creativity, memory and sleep quality

Having the personal experience of being in the present moment is the only real way to define mindfulness for yourself, as it is a unique and subjective experience.

X> ## Exercise

### And, where is your attention right now?

This short exercise is presented so you may notice what and where your attention moves to when no direction is given, other than the purpose of noticing what happens.

1. Sit or lie back and relax for a minute or two. If you wish to, close your eyes.
2. On bringing your attention back here, recall where your attention naturally moved to.

Was it a particular thought, feeling or memory?

### Review of Exercise

How much of your attention in this exercise was actually focused on simply being in the present moment?

Were you doing the exercise, but also had a part of your attention evaluating the presented material against your current ideas of reality?

Were there some doubts? Was there some internal self talk, deliberating the process, checking what was occurring?

Did a past memory appear?

Did a thought about the future appear?

All the above experiences are examples of our attention being taken away from simply experiencing being in the here and now. If you were aware of your awareness and comfortably tracking your attention then this was a brief moment of mindfulness, fantastic! If not, then at least you may now be aware of where your attention could be being distracted to.

These distractions from the present moment are what can stimulate our internal system to provide us with the fear, self-doubt and countless other psychological aberrations so many of us are subject to. We will also discover that these distractions and where they take us may actually be the resource we need to bring us to a resolution.

## Intention Behind the EK Processes

The EK processes as presented in this book are designed to work directly with your attention: first to free it from these distractions, and then to bring your attention back to the here and now - helping to integrate you back into the 'Eternal Moment of Now'.

*Emerging Moving* (Process #1), is designed to help orientate us to where we are and what we're doing and feeling in the here and now when this loss of attention occurs.

*The Six Steps* (Process #2), is one of the most basic EK processes that David developed. It was designed as a starting process for the client to begin to explore their issue in greater detail with the intention of evolving new structures around it by utilising emergent processes. It is perfect for beginning facilitators and clients to gain an understanding of the fundamental processes.

These exercises and processes utilise several ideas and technologies of the mind, most notably Emergent Knowledge which we shall start to explore in the next chapter.

It is proposed that the exercises only require your attention and focus for a few minutes each to achieve a noticeable positive result, running the processes will require more of your time and attention, usually about 60-90 minutes.

Be assured it will be worth every moment, for the more energy and attention you are able to apply to these processes then the more gains and changes to your well-being will occur.

It is imperative that when self-processing or working with a facilitator your honesty and authenticity is fully intact, if you choose to hide, lie or attempt to deceive then the effectiveness of these processes will be reduced; you are only cheating yourself. Though it must be stated, if you do recognise these things beginning to occur, then acknowledge these urges and utilise them in the process in this way much information will emerge and changes will happen.
