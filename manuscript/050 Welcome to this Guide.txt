*"Hello and welcome traveller!"*

This guidebook is your introduction to Emergent Knowledge and its application for accessing the wonderful state of Inner Peace.

It will offer you some effective exploratory techniques along with some recent advancements in the growing field of Emergence.

Sit back, relax and enjoy.

## Introduction

Well, this guide has eventually found its way into your hands. Its journey has been a long one covering many years. I'd like to say it began in 2007 however, the essence of this guide is far older than that.

How this guide arrived in your hands right now may have been from your interest in inner peace, self-development, mindfulness, Emergent Knowledge (EK) or Clean Language, David Grove (The prime creator of Emergent Knowledge technology and Clean Language) or maybe just the idea that there is something to be gained from accessing the 'Eternal Moment of Now'. And, it could also be some, all of these or none.

Regardless, I trust that right now there is an interest in where this guide can take you and in what benefits and new understandings about life and yourself may be discovered from reading and applying the methods shown.

This book has been written so that anyone who has an interest in self-development, self-improvement or mindfulness may gain a grounding in the basic Emergent Knowledge models and then be able to utilise these and the associated techniques; these have been designed for encouraging growth and insight for the practising individuals own development, as well as for delivery from trained counsellors, coaches and therapists.

The actual implementation of the techniques in this guide is key to gaining a deeper understanding of the material presented. It is not only beneficial but, I believe, quite important to have this tacit knowledge before attempting to help others achieve the same unique experience for themselves. As with all personal work, make sure you have permission from your client, partner etc. before you proceed in any of this work. 

I hope that you as my reader will run through the examples and techniques as described so you may experience and learn something new about yourself. This would be like the rediscovery of an aspect of yourself along with a new understanding about your life that was not there before. This is achieved through application, no amount of theoretical models and explanations can provide this as the structure of your understanding comes from *you* and *your* life, not a generalised set of models.

Once you have comprehended the material and positively experienced the presented techniques you will have at your disposal some simple and effective methods of calming and clearing the mind of yourself and others when needed.

A core fundamental of Clean Language was developed by David as a response to clinician led processes, where his intention was to remove the therapist from the client's process. As he developed upon this idea in the developing field of Emergent Knowledge he began to utilise algorithms, set patterns of questions and processes, to enable the client to explore the structure of their own world and hence their presenting problem or issue. 

It is the structure of these algorithms and some basic techniques developed to encourage a natural and balanced change within the individual that we will be looking at in this book. 

These methods allow one to develop a deeper holistic view of oneself in relation to one's current condition, either through facilitated actions or, as David was intending, to be 100% self-facilitated. 

This book is intended to be a step towards achieving this, providing a base knowledge and a set of basic processes to allow anyone to begin their own exploration in a gentle manner.

Note that in this book I reference Pam Saunders and Steven Saunders, they are the same person, Pam chose to adopt her full feminine form in 2015. When I reference Steven this relates to any work she carried out prior to 2015.

## The Format of this Guide

Please note that I'm an engineer, not a story teller. Therefore, as much as I would like to offer it, this material isn't a collection of anecdotes and quips. It is a clear and concise presentation of the original EK models and basic processes in which to experience and learn about EK, though my key intention in publishing this book is so you may grow and learn a little bit more about yourself and also discover how to experience the 'Eternal the Moment of Now' for yourself.

In 'THEORY I', I present the core theory of David Grove's Emergent Knowledge, in this is also included: what is meant by 'The Eternal Moment of Now', the fundamentals of Emergent Knowledge and a brief description of the philosophy of Clean. 

A distinction is made between Clean Language and Clean, as the philosophy or notion of Clean has become a concept that is now commonly used by practitioners and trainers.

A review of the facilitator's role and how this relates to guiding the client's attention is provided before we venture into 'PRACTICAL I' where two very simple EK processes are offered as practical exercises to practise the material from the first part and gain some experience of Emergent Knowledge. 

In 'THEORY II', I move over into my own developments within the field of Emergence, these are to be considered separate and not within the boundaries of Grovian Emergent Knowledge which I have reserved for David's work. The use of the term Emergence here, as opposed to Emergent Knowledge is purposeful to make this distinction. 

Here I will review and update the Iterative Pattern of Emergence (also known as The Power of Six) and also present a new model which aims to explore the interactive expressions of human behaviour, this model also provides us with a distinct description and definition for the 'Eternal Moment of Now', that moment where we may experience Inner Peace, so we now have a guide and measuring stick to help bring us to this wonderful state.

'PRACTICAL II' then follows where I offer two new interesting and valuable Emergent techniques. The first is based upon the presented model in 'THEORY II', the second is a simple yet powerful tool designed to release stuck attention and bring this back into the here and now.

Finally in 'THE FUTURE' we take a brief look at what can happen next for you on this wonderful journey.

I will reiterate the following information one more time:

**In order to fully understand this work, the completion of the exercises and processes when presented is required, giving them your full attention.**

## About the Author

Matthew Hudson is a trainer and developer of Emergence and Emergent Knowledge theory and practice. 

He began his journey in developing his understanding of the human condition at 12 years old, when he was investigating and researching psychical phenomena with his school friends and became interested in hypnosis in his teens.

As a keen reader and experimenter he developed his skills and knowledge in more therapeutic methods such as NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming), EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) and hypnotherapy. During his practice and training Matthew was introduced to David Grove's Clean Language. It was here that he became aware of the key element that had been missing from all the work he had previously studied and utilised:

C> *"All the required answers to the client's presenting issues are already within the client and do not come from the facilitator."*

Matthew became David's personal assistant in late 2007 and worked with him until his death in January 2008. During this time he was tasked with cataloguing and modelling David's final and pioneering work at that time, Emergent Knowledge.

Since then, he has published several articles on the basics of David Grove's Emergent Knowledge theory and methodology and continues to promote and share this information freely and with passion.

Matthew was later introduced to further developments of Emergence by Pam Saunders, who co-developed some of the original EK ideas with David. Pam's own developments and excursion from the Grovian methodology are known as 'The Holigral Method'.

This book is Matthew's first iteration in being an author.

## Disclaimer

Although the Emergent Knowledge methodology was originally designed to work with clients in a therapeutic way, in this guide I am not presenting these processes as therapeutic methods. If you or those you are working with are in need of any therapeutic intervention for any issue(s) presented, do not use these techniques but seek professional advice. For everything else, it is your responsibility to look after your own well-being while using these techniques.

Here, the intended use of these techniques are for your own and others self-development, coaching and education. When working with others ensure you have their permission before you begin any intervention work. 

If you choose to ignore the above advice and decide to use this material for your own or another's recovery from prior trauma - for instance you are a trained facilitator or therapist - you are accepting full responsibility for your own actions and through this you absolve the author of any liability for any repercussions from your actions.

Professional training in the theory and facilitation of Emergence and Emergent Knowledge is available on request. Please contact the author via email on:
