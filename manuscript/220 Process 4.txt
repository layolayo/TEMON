We are now about to embark upon Process #4. For reference, this process has been adapted from the Universal Conscious Practice by K.Penday. It was chosen for a couple of reasons.

First, its simplicity and naturally clean approach, which provides people learning the basics of Emergence and Clean Space with a structure to build upon. Secondly, the process has proven to offer noticeable and positive benefits for clients.

## Introduction

We will start with looking at the full process structure, and then a live session transcript is provided.

Just as Process #1 is beautiful in its simplicity, so is Process #4. For a quick overview, we can briefly express the steps of Process #4 as:

1. Describe now
2. Locate a past
3. Compare to now
4. Locate a future
5. Compare to now
6. Repeat two more times from #2 
7. Repeat five more times from #1

The process has the client repetitively locating past and future memories/ideas and comparing these to their current 'Now' state each time. After six such comparisons, a new 'Now' is recoginised and the process repeats. 

The following page provides the utilised definitions to make sure the client and the facilitator fully understand the process, then follows a full explanation of the process and its implementation.

## Utilised Definitions

These are the appropriate definitions of the main words utilised in this process, these may be used if there are any misunderstandings about the questions used.

### Where (could be any of these)

* In or to what situation, state or condition
* A place or viewpoint
* An identity or attitude
* A mood or emotion

### Might

* Used to express possibility

### Compare

* Note the similarity and dissimilarity between

## Process #4 Step by Step

### Step 1 - Now

To begin, ask your client,

C> *"And, where are you now?"*

It has sometimes been noticed that on first running this process with some clients their initial understanding of this question is to give a location. Acknowledge this, and follow up using a precursor such as:

C> *"Okay, and in life, where are you now?"*

This is a Stage 1 (Recognition) question and therefore comes with the Download and Upload features, so the client will initially be answering verbally and once they have fully expressed themselves, they should now represent (by writing or drawing) their answer on paper.

Once all the information has been represented, you will need to direct the client into placing that paper somewhere in space, as discussed in the section on Navigation.

{pagebreak}

### Step 2 - Past

The next step is bringing the client's attention into their past. Here we use the question:

C> *"And, where have you been?"*

Depending on the client's experience with the process, you could use:

* *"And in the past, where have you been?"* or
* *"And before now, where have you been?"* or
* *"And earlier in life, where have you been?"*

Following the same 'Download and Upload' procedure as above, have them verbalise and then represent their answer on paper. This could be on the same sheet(s) or a new sheet. Let the client decide. If they ask you what to do, you can reply,

C> *"And, where does that belong?"*

whilst gesturing openly towards the existing paper(s) and space.

If the client has chosen a new sheet, once it has been completed, you will need to direct the client into placing that paper in relationship to the first paper placed. Use the direction:

C> *"And, place that where it belongs in relation to where you are now."*

indicating towards the first sheet, or

C> *"And, place that where it belongs in relation to all of this."*

gesturing across the emerging client's landscape.

{pagebreak}

### Step 3 - Compare

The client now has two representations ('the past' and 'now'), we are going to have the client notice the differences and similarities between these two responses.

Ask,

C> *"And compare that to where you are now."*

indicating for the client which information you are referring to as you say it. So you would gently gesture towards the information/paper for the past, and then the information/paper for now.

You may choose to exchange 'where you have been' for 'that' in the question, for example,

C> *"And compare where you have been to where you are now."*

This addition to the instruction has limited value and has been found to be best utilised only in the first few iterations - then falling back to the original usage of 'that' later on.

Any new information that emerges in this stage should also be written down. The client may choose to do this on either the existing sheets or on a new sheet or sheets altogether.

{pagebreak}

A> For each new sheet of paper, follow the above procedure and have the client place it in a space where it belongs in relationship to the other sheet(s). As this technique will become the norm throughout the process, there is no need for us to keep repeating this in each step going forward.

Note that once the client has more than one piece (sheet) of information in their space and they are now considering the relating spatial relationships between them, it can happen that existing sheets have to move their existing position(s) to accommodate the new emerging information.

Allow the client the time and space to reorganise their world. This is the moment that the space becomes psychoactive for the client. Remember, do not interfere with this process, do not offer 'friendly' assistance or your own inferences about where or what the placement of the papers means.

{pagebreak}

### Step 4 - Future

Now we are looking to take the client's attention towards their future. This step is run exactly the same as Step 2, however, the question asked is:

C> *"And, where might you be?"*

Alternatives could be:

* *"And later in life, where might you be?"*

or

* *"And in the future, where might you be?"*

{pagebreak}

### Step 5 - Compare

This is virtually exactly the same as Step 3; however, have the client compare the future space to the present space by directing them with:

* *"And compare that to where you are now."* 

or

* *"And compare where you might be to where you are now."*

{pagebreak}

### Step 6 - Reiterate

We now have, spoken then represented by the client, where they are now (present), where they have been in the past, and where they might be in the future, along with any further information gleaned from the two comparisons.

We will now reiterate Steps 2 through to 5 until the client has explored and compared three past spaces and three future spaces. The image below gives a visual representation of how this step of the process runs.

![Reiteration of Steps 2 to 5](images/Process_2.png)

For the instructions given in these repeated steps, the word 'else' may be utilised to confirm for the client that a 'new' event or moment in time is required.

It has been known for some clients to continue to focus on the same future and past spaces or very similar alternatives. This, however, is simply part of the process; allow them to go through this. The use of 'else' aims to help take their attention to other times and spaces.

* *"And, where else have you been?"*
* *"And, where else might you be?"*

When asking for *"Where else might you be?"* clients are being given the opportunity to look in their own way at all the possibilities and choices available to them. The facilitator and process are not advocating or dismissing the potential successes or failures of the client - this is up to them.

{pagebreak}

### Step 7 - Continue the Reiteration

We are now going to repeat Steps 1 through to 6 this is generally repeated another five times. On each new full round, it is recommended to restart with a new sheet of paper and have the previous 'Now' sheet placed where it belongs in relationship with everything else, before beginning the new moment of 'Now', if it has not already been placed.

![Six Iterations of Step 6](images/Six_Stage_Sixes.png)

Running six sets of Steps 1 to 6 is not a hard and fast rule. If the client comes to a new deeper understanding - such as suddenly realising how all their previously unrelated past and future moments are all connected - or they suddenly realise that they're (stated with a resounding "I" or "Me") now very much in the room with you in the 'Here and Now', accompanied with a big smile and sense of relief, then the session may move straight to the next step.

{pagebreak}

### Step 8 - Finishing Off

The finishing questions of the session are:

C> *"And, what do you know now?"*

Then,

C> *"And, what is the difference between what you knew*
C> *at the beginning and what you know now?"*

And finally,

C> *"And, knowing that, what difference does that make?"*

## Summary of Process #4

Have the client verbalise and represent on paper the answers to each step below. These papers, once created, are placed in the space around the client in relationship to everything else.

A single round of the process looks like this, where after each question or instruction the client represents their response:

* *"And, where are you now?"*
* *"And, where have you been?"*
* *"And, compare that to where you are now"*
* *"And, where might you be?"*
* *"And, compare that to where you are now"*
* *"And, where else have you been?"*
* *"And, compare that to where you are now"*
* *"And, where else might you be?"*
* *"And, compare that to where you are now"*
* *"And, where else have you been?"*
* *"And, compare that to where you are now"*
* *"And, where else might you be?"*
* *"And, compare that to where you are now"*

This structure is then repeated until the client experiences the 'Here and Now', or a recognition of a positive shift of understanding about their life occurs. This generally occurs on the sixth iteration, but not always. If you're required to maintain a time limit to the session, then six iterations is recommended.

Finally, ask the finishing questions,

* *"And, what do you know now?"*
* *"And, what is the difference between what you knew at the beginning and what you know now?"*
* *"And, knowing that, what difference does that make?"*

## An Analysis of Process #4

A> *"You cannot suffer the past or future because they do not exist. What you are suffering is your memory and your imagination."*
A>
A> Sadhguru

### Simplicity Itself

Throughout this process, the client explores what is happening in the here and now, by iteratively focusing their attention on prior and future constructs. Through this, we begin to separate what is actually happening now, and what is been created by the client about their past or their future in the here and now.

The end product of the process is when the client comes to a new understanding of their life and they are fully present in the room with you. This also beneficially recovers their lost attention units that were previously allocated to stuck ideas or thoughts about their life.

{pagebreak}

### A Very Clean Start

Our starting question, *"And, where are you now?"*, offers the client a way to express themselves with the potential for some evaluation of their life up to the here and now.

Things that may be considered and voiced by the client are:

* What it is that brought them to this moment
* Where they are heading
* What their problem is
* What their purpose in life is
* How they are not getting what they want
* What they do not like about themselves

The question *"And, where are you now?"* is chosen to purposefully not request an intention, not to propose a goal or an ambition, not to suppose the client is wrong or broken in any way. It is simply to discover where they are in their life at this moment. If they choose to go delving any deeper, that is their choice.

{pagebreak}

### Spotting Differences and Similarities

The level of our ability to recognise differences between what we are experiencing is directly proportional to the depth of what we, as individuals, are capable of experiencing. That may seem an obvious statement at first reading, but it does have far-reaching consequences, and those consequences are within our control, if we choose to adapt and become cognizant of our own experience of life.

For instance, the extent of our vocabulary provides us with the communicating power to express ourselves to the extent that our vocabulary allows. If we do not have the words and the psychological structures of particular concepts, we are unable to fully comprehend and attend to various experiences.

Examples of this are those people who have studied and gained a  knowledge of music, art, craftsmanship, architecture, etc. Their experience of a particular related item and that of another person without a similar level of understanding, will be very different - the aspects of appreciation will be different.

I often make the point, when training NLP and EK, that one of the purposes of the training and learning of the models is that as we become more and more aware of our inner structures our self-awareness or the intelligence of ourselves increases, thus offering us more control in life.

We are teaching ourselves the finer and finer distinctions we have about our life and human connectivity. The fewer distinctions we have, the more everything is the same, and our ability to make valued and effective judgements is impeded.

It is for all the above reasons, that this process purposefully includes the step to compare where the client is now and where they might be or have been, we call this 'Splitting Time'. This comparison has the client bring their attention to what is actually different and similar between these two independent constructs.

As a facilitator, it is very interesting to take a mental note of the categories of similarity and differences proposed by the client - especially for later more advanced Emergent processes.

During the 'Comparison' step, the facilitator may specifically request similarities and differences, especially if differences are not forthcoming. Sometimes clients in 'stuck' problem situations are unable to spot them.

Being unable to Split Time, through the use of spotting differences, may have the client continuing to have parts of their historical record connecting to, and thus occurring, in the present moment.

C> **Spotting new similarities and differences is key to success in this process.**

### More on Splitting Time

Splitting Time is where the things (e.g. events, ideas, incidents) which are not here and now are looked at and checked against the here and now. Doing this provides the client an opportunity to disconnect these structures. This splits apart these (defining) moments for the client, and has them re-placing these prior or future events back to where they belong or come from.

If there are moments in the client's past, or potential future, which they are uncomfortable viewing, they are in control of choosing to go or not go there. Later on they may find themselves taking a peek and, through multiple iterations of viewing over time, they may come to a new understanding of these events and, finally, view them in their entirety with no ill effects.

And at some point, as an added bonus, the client may also come to realise that all the things they have been worrying about are no longer an actual present time reality, and have, unfortunately, just been unconsciously getting created by themselves in the here and now! This can be quite a revelation when directly experienced, and is even more powerful once they notice and decide to stop doing it.

### A Little Troubleshooting

It is worth recognising that in the beginning some clients will only look at generalised times in their past or future. If this is becoming a pattern, and no progress is being made, you can ask,

C> *"And, what is your first memory connected to that?"* or,

C> *"And when have you had that before?"*

This approach may also be utilised if the client suddenly begins to express emotions, ideas or thoughts that were not there in the beginning.

Having a client access specific memories has been shown to offer a deeper experience. The details provided of such a memory would have some or all of the following conditions:

* Having a specific time and place
* Who was there
* What happened
* How long that particular episode lasted
* The actions and choices made in that moment
* The emotions, ideas and thoughts associated

There is an interesting reference here to David and his follow up questions especially when dealing with the Iterative Pattern of Sixes, for after asking for the First Memory, he would follow up with asking for the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and then Sixth. Though, this iterative pattern is not currently recommended whilst running this process.
